{"big k.r.i.t.": [". to be out on the road and perform in front of \u2013 even me opening \u2013 3000-4000 people\u2026 some of them that may be familiar with the music some not and to get the kind of response that ive been getting and gaining them fans its always beautiful. then to be inspired by a legend like talib kweli perform and seeing macklemore & ryan lewis kill it every night just seeing how intricate their show is and how much they put into it. thats inspiring to me. it started on october 22nd and i performed in some places that i never thought i would perform: three times in the theater at madison square garden all that shit. weve been in some arenasjustin: youre preparing your next album cadillactica\u2026  krit: yeah cadillactica  justin: and one of the big things you revealed was that youd just be rapping  krit: yeah just gonna be an artist  justin: tell me about the dynamic there and how things change for you  krit: i will say that im still gonna produce on the album but im not gonna produce all of it. i saw that i produced all my projects up until live from the underground. i was doing all the beats all the mixing writing the hooks and things of that nature. this time i wanted to see what it was like working with other producers and to get in the studio with people i respected like terrace martin dj dahi jim jonsin ", " 9th wonder. i felt like for the first time i got the chance to just be an artist. they played the best beat they made for a nigga and i go in and write. its like being free from a lot of the pressure i normally go through when you gotta make the beat write the hook and its been love man. im still gonna produce the majority of the album. i dont want people to get too scared. ", " i mean i had to get out of my comfort zone so that creatively i could grow  justin: another project thats been discussed is country cousins with yelawolf and we dont really know the status on that one right now. is that still on the table  krit: man we gonna figure it out. me and the homie yelawolf always seem to tour a lot and work a lot. a lot of it is a timing thing and so lord willing if it happens its going down. and if it dont were gonna figure out how to make it happen later on in life  justin: one of the cool things you were involved in recently was the crooked lettaz tribute track fire water iiwith big sant and tito lopez. what was it like being involved in that and honoring such a historic song in mississippi hip hop  krit: it was crazy. it was big sants idea cause it went on the great american mattress sale project and he asked me to be a part of it along with tito lopez. with all three of us being from mississippi we really got to show to what we grew up listening to and where we came from. we got to pay homage to david banner kamikaze and crooked lettaz. and for the new generation that didnt know about them hopefully they hear our version and go back and listen to the original. cause thats what its all about letting people know what inspired us and how we grew up  justin: i know i got to talk with kamikaze and he was very excited about that  krit: yeah it came out super jamming that beat is phenomenal  justin: grey skies is one of my favorite albums so i was glad to see yall do that. now speaking of legends i interviewed 8ball last year and he was very intrigued by the idea of you producing an 8ball & mjg album  krit: thats one of those things thats on my list of milestones to do \u2013 to be able to produce an 8ball & mjg album a ugk album and to be a part of an outkast album. i look forward to and would love to do that. its a blessing that ive except for andre 3000 been able to work with everyone i just mentioned. its one thing to have somebody featured on your record but its another to produce for them. not necessarily be singing or rapping on their song but to give them a track. all these artists i love them and grew up listening to them and study them as well. you know it would just be me trying to tap into the 90s and what it was like to make a comin out hard or in my lifetime and try to create from that perspective  justin: like you said youre definitely a student of the game and a lot of your music pays homage to those that have come before you. why is that so important to you to make sure that legacy lives on in the new generation  krit: because i feel like im pulling my weight as a southern artist and being country but i want people to understand that im not the first lyrical dude from south. theres been so many people before me and im just really trying to pave my way and represent to the best of my ability. but like i said you got the ugk outkast goodie mob the whole dungeon family three 6 mafia project pat scarface trick daddy\u2026 theres mad lyrical people that came from the south. sometimes in the interviews people ask hows it feel to be from the south and be lyrical and im like its always been like that though  justin: right  krit: we just told it from our perspective. ugk is from a small city like im from but they made it cool to be country and southern. when i see a slab or some 84s and somebody pop trunk with neon lights i been knowing about that shit forever. so to see the whole world on it now is exciting because to me theyre finally starting to get the culture  justin: absolutely. now i want to go back to your beginnings a bit. you started out with the see me on top series of mixtapes and i want to get into your mindset back then. what was big k.r.i.t. looking to do when he dropped the first see me on top tape  krit: man get signed all the tapes i dropped up until return of 4eva was to get signed. it was not about dropping an album not going platinum not going gold not selling. it was just getting signed and that was very hard thing to do where im from. and i didnt know anybody in my circle that was signed back then. that was that step: getting a label to pay attention. not even getting a song on the radio cause at some point i was like if i can just get an a&r then i can get on the radio. but yeah when i was dropping those projects it was simply to get signed bro; to get enough attention that someone would invest in me and put my music out on a level where music people could hear  justin: now you had the see me on top tapes as well as ones like the last king but the breakout project was obviously k.r.i.t. wuz here. what do you think was different about that project and could you see as you were making it that it would be something special  krit: k.r.i.t. wuz here was me getting to a point where i didnt know if i wanted to rap anymore. i couldnt take care of myself financially. i would have meetings with a&rs and id play them a record like children of the world and theyd say thats not want people want to hear right now. hometown hero and country shit i did in 2009 around that time and we put them out in 2010. but they were older records that a lot of people heard and said that aint gonna work. so k.r.i.t. wuz here was more of me on some last hurrah i just want people to hear this music and what i got to say. whether it work out or not i did my best and go back to mississippi to take care of myself  justin: lets talk about live from the underground your first album for def jam. many fans commented that you had given them too much good music for free leading up to the album so they werent as impressed as they thought they would be. i know i wrote a very positive review of it and remember seeing a lot of opinions from both fans and critics that it just felt like another one and didnt have the same impact as the previous projects. what was your feeling on that do you think that you maybe did give people too much before lp  krit: i think the thing that i dealt with ", " was when youre doing mixtapes and theyre free you can sample what you want. you can do whatever you want include however many songs you want sequence it how you want and then you just drop it. its that mentality when you work on a mixtape. but when you go to an album you cant drop it whenever you want you cant sample anything you want ", " you cant sequence it however you want. its gotta fit in a different way and be packaged a certain way for people and i dealt with that. i think that was the difference between my album and my mixtapes because i was fighting just wanting to let people hear it versus having a game plan a deadline a roll out and all these things that happen when youre dropping an album. and i know that now so the second album is more like instead of dropping a mixtape a month before i drop my album im just gonna focus on this album. im still gonna give people music. im gonna be a part of the game cause i produce for people and collaborate with people. but my album i want to focus all my attention on it so that i make something that makes you feel like ive never heard anything sonically like this. and thats why i chose the name cadillactica. its like why would you name it that because i want to create a planet around my music sounds dont sound the same thats the difference. and just going back to what people know me for and thats creativity. 4eva n a day is probably one of my most creative projects to date because its time sequenced which is very hard to do. so yeah im excited  justin: thats great. is there any interesting work coming up that might surprise fans or maybe collaborating with someone out of left-field  krit: damn man anything coming up\u2026 im gonna be a part of the lupe ", " album. im on ludas album. got stuff with my podnas mookie jones and smoke dza too. its gonna be a big year for all my family. and for me its just about branding multi being the best producer in the game and being the type of producer that i know i can go work with anybody. thats the next step  justin: i cant get out of here without this question  krit: lets go ", "  justin: the alumni album: is it ever gonna happen  krit: yeah its gonna happen but for me its about dropping my album ", "", "  ive heaped plenty of praise at big k.r.i..t. over the years but its well deserved. since 2010 the man has been on a meteoric rise through the hip hop ranks and established himself as one of the best in the game today. on the tail end of his most recent tour i got to speak with the meridian native about his journey up till now and whats in store for the future. over the course of our discussion k.r.i.t. explains his early struggles as an artist from a small town in mississippi and why k.r.i.t. wuz here could have been his last project. we also touch on fan disappointment with his major label debut how that experience better prepared him for his second album cadillactica why he wont be producing the lp in its entirety and much more justin: how did the latest tour go for you krit: the tours been love with macklemore and talib  sant dropping another tape and then us going to do that. were both solo artists outside of being a group so its very important that we brand that and then bring it together. that way neither one of us is depending on a group project its just something we did because of the time  justin: alright man thanks for taking the time  krit: no doubt i appreciate it  "]}
