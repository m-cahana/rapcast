{"yelawolf": ["", "   i went through the fire flames made me pure feds were fishing for a confession i aint bite the lord took a tour of the country in a federal van the light overcame the darkness in the devilish land knowing that the change must come but sam cook seems 15 minute phone calls press 5 when it rings locked doors open my mind find peace the animal i became is tamed a kind beast attending birthdays through pictures tears on concrete refusing to lose over the years of defeat now i speak the truth the try to acquire my choir been to hell and back this is trial by fire desire to find the higher power in the hour of despair cutting out the stitches yes theres bridges to repair holding on to whats left trying to stay right after the chaos of the night comes daylight  "]}
