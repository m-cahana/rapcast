{"trinidad james": ["", "   there are three types of men in this world ones that want the perfect girl ones that just want a girl and of course the ones that just want some pussy and theres nothing wrong with either three based off of or according to their reasons in action learn to accept the opposite sex for who they are dont linger in cancerous relationships or dwell on anything that can turn negative dwelling on things you cannot overcome is meaningless continue on to dwell though because what i have come to reason with or better yet understand is comfort is one of the key pieces to life less stress equals more life my theory is that we can never be perfect because of sin but we can reach our mind and bodies own version of that perfected state the feeling of being mentally perfect is better than being literally perfect in my personal opinion and based off of my studies of human nature i feel like life works better when you have to work for your peace slash comfort many people would disagree and i understand why initially a red flag in your mind would wave back and fourth many people in the world have success and wealth and many many more want the same thing achieving these fantasies can take you down the same roads while on your road though i want you to always try to remember one key thing appreciate the peace you currently possess nothing at all is wrong with focusing on your future or even wanting better things in the future but dont allow those future goals slash fantasies to tamper with your current success what youre gonna understand one day or the next is that no matter what you want in this future it will always be based on what you are doing in the present the present is very important the future cannot work without the present now after my mini 101 on life and living it have any of these three types of men listed above ever come into your life or reside in it currently im a libra so ill address the females that are currently in a stable relationship first no diss to single women but the purpose of these words are to motivate your conscious to understand who the woman in your heart really is as humans in general i really truly feel it is very important for you to know who you really are very important the more you know yourself the more you know what you wont go for whether it is jobs or friends or even food last but not least when it comes to self understanding you will have the best grip possible when it comes to relationships relationships matter so much in my personal opinion because being lonely is something the mind has to be forced to understand i feel that we were meant to be with someone at least something 2 or 3 haha but to each his own any time the opposite sex can make you a certain type of way and theres a reason behind that positives are always looking for a positive but will take a negative because there is always a possibility they can make them a positive possible but no guarantee  "]}
