{"kendrick lamar": ["  a drizzly sunday morning in compton the sky an un-california-ish gray. into the parking lot of a local hamburger stand pulls a chromed-out black mercedes suv driven by 27-year-old kendrick lamar arguably the most talented rapper of his generation. there are a half-dozen guys from the neighborhood waiting to meet him: l turtle g-weed. i grew up with all these cats lamar says. he nods to mingo a compton-born sweetheart who is roughly the size of the truck he arrived in: i dont need to hire a bodyguard. look how fucking big he is the burger joint tams sits at the corner of rosecrans and central a famous local spot recently made infamous when suge knight allegedly ran over two men with his truck in the parking lot killing one of them. homey died right here g-weed says pointing to a dark spot on the asphalt. that security camera caught everything. theyre building a case.  lamar grew up just six blocks from here in a little blue three-bedroom house at 1612 137th st. across the street is the louisiana fried chicken where he used to get the three-piece meal with fries and lemonade; over there is the rite aid where he walked to buy milk for his little brothers. tams was another hangout. this is where i seen my second murder actually. he says. eight years old walking home from mcnair elementary. dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food and homey ran up boom boom - smoked him. he saw his first murder at age five a teenage drug dealer gunned down outside lamars apartment building. after that he says you just get numb to it.  its almost noon but lamar is just starting his day - having spent a late night in the studio scrambling to finish his new album to pimp a butterfly which has to be done in five days. hes dressed casually in a gray hoodie maroon sweatpants and white socks with black slides but recognizable enough that an old lady in line decides to tease him while complaining about the heat inside. yall need to put the air conditioner on she calls to the manager. kendrick lamar is here  lamar may be a two-time grammy winner with a platinum debut executive-produced by dr. dre and with fans from kanye west to taylor swift. but here at tams hes also kendrick duckworth paula and kennys son. inside a middle-aged woman who just left church comes up and gives him a hug and he buys lunch for a cart-toting lady he knows used to be a harmless crack addict. she used to chase us with sticks and stuff he says. outside an old man in a motorized wheelchair scoots over to introduce himself. he says he moved here in 1951 when compton was still majority-white. back in the day we had the baddest cars in l.a. he says. i just wanted you to know where you came from. its a hell of a neighborhood.  on his breakthrough album 2012s good kid m.a.a.d city lamar made his name by chronicling this neighborhood vividly evoking a specific place this same stretch of rosecrans and a specific time in the summer of 2004 between 10th and 11th grade. it was a concept album about adolescence told with cinematic precision through the eyes of someone young enough to recall every detail as in: me and my niggas four deep in a white toyota/a quarter tank of gas one pistol one orange soda  lamars parents moved here from chicago in 1984 three years before kendrick was born. his dad kenny duckworth was reportedly running with a south side street gang called the gangster disciples so his mom paula oliver issued an ultimatum. she said i cant fuck with you if you aint trying to better yourself lamar recounts. we cant be in the streets forever. they stuffed their clothes in two black garbage bags and boarded a train to california with $500. they were going to go to san bernardino lamar says. but my auntie tina was in compton. she got em a hotel until they got on their feet and my mom got a job at mcdonalds. for the first couple of years they slept in their car or motels or in the park when it was hot enough. eventually they saved enough money to get their first apartment and thats when they had me.  lamar has a lot of good memories of compton as a kid: riding bikes doing back flips off friends roofs sneaking into the living room during his parents house parties. id catch him in the middle of the dance floor with his shirt off his mom says. like what the... get back in that room then theres one of his earliest memories - the afternoon of april 29th 1992 the first day of the south central riots  kendrick was four. i remember riding with my pops down bullis road and looking out the window and seeing motherfuckers just running he says. i can see smoke. we stop and my pops goes into the autozone and comes out rolling four tires. i know he didnt buy them. im like whats going on says kenny we were all taking stuff. thats the way it was in the riots  then we get to the house lamar continues and him and my uncles are like we fixing to get this we fixing to get that we fixing to get all this shit im thinking theyre robbing. theres some real mayhem going on in l.a. then as time progresses im watching the news hearing about rodney king and all this i said to my mom so the police beat up a black man and now everybodys mad ok. i get it now.  weve been sitting on the patio a while when lamar sees someone he knows at the bus stop. matt jeezy what up bro matt jeezy nods. thats my boy lamar says. hes part of the inner circle. lamar has a few friends like this guys hes known all his life. but often hed rather be by himself  he was always a loner kendricks mom says. lamar agrees: i was always in the corner of the room watching. he has two little brothers and one younger sister but until he was seven he was an only child. he was so precocious his parents nicknamed him man-man. i grew up fast as fuck he says. my moms used to walk me home from school - we didnt have no car - and wed talk from the county building to the welfare office. he would ask me questions about section 8 and the housing authority so id explain it to him his mom says. i was keeping it real.  the duckworths survived on welfare and food stamps and paula did hair for $20 a head. his dad had a job at kfc but at a certain point says lamar i realized his work schedule wasnt really adding up. it wasnt until later that he suspected kenny was probably making money off the streets. they wanted to keep me innocent lamar says now. i love them for that. to this day he and his dad have never discussed it. i dont know what type of demons he has lamar says but i dont wanna bring them shits up. says kenny i dont want to talk about that bad time. but i did what i had to do.  theres a famous story from tom pettys childhood in which a 10-year-old tom sees elvis shooting a movie near his hometown in florida takes on look at the white cadillac and the girls and decides to become a rock star on the spot. lamar has a similar story - only for him its sitting on his dads shoulders outside the compton swap meet age eight watching dr. dre and 2pac shoot a video for california love. i want to say they were in a white bentley lamar says. it was actually black. these motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car and pac stood up on the passenger seat like yo what the fuck he laughs. yelling at the police just like on his motherfucking songs. he gave us what we wanted.  being a rapper was far from preordained for lamar. as late as middle school he had a noticeable stutter. just certain words he says. it came when i was excited or in trouble. he loved basketball - he was short but quick - and dreamed of making it to the nba. but in seventh grade an english teacher named mr. inge turned him on to poetry - rhymes metaphors double-entendres - and lamar fell in love. you could put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper and theyd make sense to you he says. i liked that.  at home lamar started writing non-stop. we used to wonder what he was doing with all that paper his dad says. i thought he was doing homework i didnt know he was writing lyrics. i had never heard him say profanity before says his mom. then i found his little rap lyrics and it was all eff you. d-i-c-k. im like oh my god kendricks a cusser  an a student lamar flirted with the idea of going to college. i could have went. i should have went. he still might: its always in the back of my mind. its not too late. but by the time he was in high school he was running with a bad crowd. this is the crew he raps about on good kid m.a.a.d city - the ones doing robberies home invasions running from the cops  once his mom found a bloody hospital gown from a trip he took to the er with one of his little homeys who got smoked. another time she found him curled up crying in the front yard. she thought he was sad because his grandmother had just died: i didnt know somebody had shot at him. one night the police knocked on their door and said he was involved in an incident in their neighborhood and his parents in a bout of tough love kicked him out for two days. and thats a scary thing lamar says because you might not come back.  after a couple of hours the mood on rosecrans starts to shift. an ambulance roars by sirens blaring. in the middle of the street a homeless man is shouting at passing cars. lamar starts to grow uneasy his eyes glancing at the corners. i ask if everythings ok. its the temperature he says. its uh raising a little bit. a few minutes later one of his friends - whos been cruising back and forth on his bicycle all afternoon patrolling the perimeter - calls out rollers and a few seconds later two l.a. county sherrif cruisers round the corner. there they go lamar says as they hit their lights and take off  as a teenager the majority of my interactions with police were not good lamar says. there were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. but then you have ones from the valley. they never met me in their life but since im a kid in basketball shorts and a white t-shirt they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. sixteen years old he says nodding toward the street. right there by that bus stop. even if hes not a good kid that dont give you the right to slam a minor on the ground or pull a pistol on him.  lamar says hes had police pull guns on him on two occasions. the first was when he was 17 cruising around compton with his friend moose. he says a cop spotted their flashy green camaro and pulled them over and when moose couldnt find his license fast enough the cop pulled a gun. he literally put the beam on my boys head lamar recalls. i remember driving off in a silence feeling violated and him being so angry a tear dropped from his eye. the story of the second time is murkier: lamar wont say what he and his friends were up to only that a cop drew his gun and they ran. we was in the wrong he admits. but we just kids. its not worth pulling your gun out over. especially when we running away.  friends of his werent so lucky. just after midnight on june 13th 2007 officers from the lapds southeast division responded to a domestic-violence call on east 120th street about five minutes from lamars house. there they found his good friend d.t. allegedly holding a 10-inch knife. according to police d.t. charged and an officer opened fire killing him. it never really quite added up lamar says. but heres the crazy thing. normally when we find out somebody got killed the first thing we say is who did it where we gotta go its a gang altercation. but this time it was the police - the biggest gang in california. youll never win against them.  on an otherwise positive song called hiiipower from his 2011 mixtape section.80 lamar rapped i got my finger on the motherfucking pistol/aim it at a pig charlottes web is going to miss you. its an unsettling line especially coming from a rapper who often subverts gangster tropes but rarely trafficks in them. i was angry he says. to be someone with a good heart and to still be harassed as a kid...it took a toll on me. soon youre just saying fuck everything. that line was me getting those frustrations out. and im glad i could get them out with a pen and a paper.  about three years ago lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year old named trayvon martin had been shot to death in a florida subdivision. it just put a whole new anger inside me lamar says. it made me remember how i felt. being harassed my partners being killed. he grabbed a pen and started writing and within an hour he had rough verses for a new song the blacker the berry: coming from the bottom of mankind my hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide you hate me dont you you hate my people your plan is to terminate my culture...but as soon as lamar wrote he also started thinking about his own time in the streets and all the wrong ive done. so he started writing a new verse in which he turned the microscope on himself. how can he criticize america for killing young black men he asks when young black men are often just as good at it as the songs narrator put it why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street/when gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me/hypocrite  when it was finally released last month the song sparked a rash of think pieces with some listeners saying lamar was ignoring the real problem: the systemic racism that created the conditions for black-on-black crime in the first place. coupled with a recent billboard interview in which lamar seemed to suggest that some of the responsibility for preventing killings like that of michael brown lay with black people themselves some fans thought he sounded like a right-wing apologist. the rapper azealia banks called his comments the dumbest shit ive ever heard a black man say.  lamar says hes not an idiot. i know the history he says. im not talking about that. im talking from a personal standpoint. im talking about gangbanging  he grew up surrounded by gangs. some of his close friends were west side pirus a local blood affiliate and his mom says her brothers were compton crips. one of his uncles did a 15-year stretch for robbery and another is locked up now for the same; his uncle tony meanwhile was shot in the head at a burger stand when kendrick was a boy. but lamar says he was taught that change starts from within. my moms always told me: how long you gonna play the victim he says. i can say im mad and i hate everything but nothing really changes until i change myself. so no matter how much bullshit weve been through as a community im strong enough to say fuck that and acknowledge myself and my own struggles.  when lamar released the new albums first single i last september many fans werent sure what to make of it. a blast of pop positivity that samples an isley brothers hit recently heard soundtracking a swiffer commercial it felt like an odd move for lamar whos known for more complex fare. people called it corny mocked its feel-good happy-style chorus i love myself. i know people might think that means im conceited or something lamar says. no. it means im depressed.  lamar is sitting in the santa monica recording studio where he made much of his new album dressed in a charcoal sweatsuit and reeboks. his baseball cap is pulled low over his sprouting braids and he speaks softly and thoughtfully with long pauses between sentences  ive woken up in the morning and felt like shit he says. feeling guilty. feeling angry. feeling regretful. as a kid from compton you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth.  lamar says he intended i as a keep ya head up-style message for his friends in the penitentiary. but he also wrote it for himself to ward off dark thoughts. my partner jason estrada told me if you dont attack it it will attack you lamar says. if you sit around moping feeling sad and stagnant its gonna eat you alive. i had to make that record. its a reminder. it makes me feel good.  lamar also points out that the fans who scratched their heads at i had yet to hear u - its counterpoint on the album. i is the answer to u he says. the latter is four and a half minutes of devastating honesty with lamar almost sopping over a discordant beat berating himself about his lack of confidence and calling himself a fucking failure. its the sound of a man staring into the mirror and hating what he sees punctuated by a self-aware hook: loving you is complicated.  that was one of the hardest songs i had to write he says. theres some very dark moments in there. all my insecurities and selfishness and letdowns. that shit is depressing as a motherfucker. but it helps though he says. it helps.  lamar has documented his inner struggles before most notably on swimming pools from good kid which explores his past troubles with alcohol and his familys history of addiction. but once he got successful he says things got more difficult not less. one of his biggest issues was self esteem - accepting that he deserved to be where he was. and some of that came from his discomfort around white people  im going to be 100 percent real with you lamar says. in all my days of schooling from preschool all the way up to 12th grade there was not one white person in my class. literally zero. before he started touring he had barely left compton; when he finally did the culture shock threw him. imagine only discovering that when youre 25 lamar says. youre around people you dont know how to communicate with. you dont speak the same lingo. it brings confusion and insecurity. questioning how did i get here what am i doing that was a cycle i had to break quick. but at the same time youre excited because youre in a different environment. the world keeps going outside the neighborhood.  the week good kid was released lamar began keeping a diary. it really came from the conversations i had with dre he says. hearing him tell stories about all these moments and how it went by like that - he snaps. i didnt want to forget how i was feeling when my album dropped or when i went back to compton.  lamar ended up filling multiple notebooks. theres a lot of weird shit in there he says. lot of drawings visuals. where as good kid was an exercise in millennial nostalgia to pimp a butterfly is firmly in the present. its his take on what it means to be young and black in america today - and more specifically what it means to be kendrick lamar navigating success expectation and his own self-doubt  musically the album - at least the half that hes comfortable sharing so far - is adventurous borrowing from free jazz and 1970s funk. lamar says he listened to a lot of miles davis and parliament. his producer mark sounwave spears whos known lamar since he was 16 says every producer ive ever met was sending me stuff - but there was a one-in-a-million chance you could send us a beat that actually fit what we were doing. ali says lamar works synesthetically - he talks in colors all the time: make it sound purple. make it sound light green.  but of all the albums colors the most prominent is black. there are allusions to the entire sweep of african-american history from the dispora to the cotton fields to the harlem renaissance to obama. mortal man inspired in part by a 2014 trip to south africa name-checks leaders from mandela to mlk all the way back to moses. on king kunta a stomping blast of james brown funk he imagines himself as the titular slave from roots shouting the punchline everybody wanna cut the legs off him/black man taking no losses  hanging over it all of course are the tragedies of the past three years: trayvon martin michael brown eric garner tamir rice. says sounwave to me the album is perfect for right now. if the world was happy maybe wed give you a happy album. but right now we are not happy.  lamar - who calls the album fearful honest and unapologetic - is coy about what the title means. just putting the word pimp next to butterfly... he says then laughs. its a trip. thats something that will be a phrase forever. itll be taught in college courses - i truly believe that. i ask if hes the pimp or the butterfly and he just smiles. i could be both he says  on the last day of february lamar and two dozen loved ones are gathered at a $6 million mansion in calabasas for a surprise birthday party for sounwave. the estate belongs to top dawg tiffeth part of a group of properties so exclusive theyre protected by two security gates the second presumably to keep out the riff-raff inhabiting the mansions inside the first. nba star paul pierce lives across the street and multiple kardashians live around the block. theres probably a million dollars in this driveway says lamars tour manager a friendly dude named retone as he surveys the audis benzes and range rovers out front  lamar lives down the coast with his longtime girlfriend whitney he has called her his best friend in a tri-level condo he rents in the south bay on the water. he still hasnt splurged on much: so far his biggest purchase is a relatively modest house in the suburbs east of l.a. which he bought for his parents more than a year ago. top dawg says that at first his mom didnt want to take it because it meant giving up their section 8 status. kendrick had to reassure her: its ok mom. were good. it was hard times and weve been through a lot says kenny. but like drake said: we started from the bottom now were here.  in the kitchen the girls are snacking and chatting while the guys are in the home theater watching the new kobe documentary. in the dining room lamar is talking to sounwave and his manager dave free trying to make last-minute changes to the record thats due out in two weeks  eventually whitney comes in and rests her hand on lamars shoulder. theyre about the blow out the candles she says. everyone moves into the kitchen to sing happy birthday to sounwave and lamar stands beside whitney his arm around her waist. they look happy. sounwave is about to blow out the candles when someone tells him to make a wish - but before he can lamar jumps in and makes one for him. i wish he says smiling for hot beats  "]}
