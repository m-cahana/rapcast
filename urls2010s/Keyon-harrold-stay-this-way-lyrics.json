{"big k.r.i.t.": ["  times like this seem rehearsed times like this shine like golden carry on i love you nights of bliss  and as time unfolds into an illusion the present is a memory just be still and stay this way  forever young time is ecstacy most people search and never feel this way but when i saw your face i knew i knew that it was you i offer you my through and through you save my heart and make it new an act of sacrifice if i should go astray youll always know you have my soul just like the wind plays with the flames you mesmerise a foolish game be my only memories just be still and stay this way  just be still in the mist of this day ... place when time dont matter and our thoughts can just be scatters we sail away in this beautiful serenade and that bouquet youve thrown never lands living the first day i touched your soul over and over and over again i promise to be gentle with these sutures to patch your heart and calm that bruising from the past experiences of life and that shade that dimmed your light i hope you shine like the supernova in this zenith if i could i would say this backwards to show you that i mean it it mean i you show to backwards this say i could if zenith you know what im trying to say i just hope that when all the world leaves me be that you choose to stay and that we can rendezvous in paradise if either of us pass away  stay this way stay this way stay this way  and as time unfolds into an illusion your presence is a memory just be still and stay this way  "]}
