{"childish gambino": [" a few lines in the closing track ii. life: the biggest troll ", "", "  prior to the announcement of the album donald tweeted and retweeted the term roscoes wetsuit a lot. at first the term seemed kind of random and irrelevant but looking at in the context of because the internet a couple of ideas make sense. early on in the script there is a conversation between sasha a girl the boys meet at the beach and the boy that gives us a good idea of what it could mean  sasha: you goin in the boy: dont know yet sasha: then whyd you put on your wetsuit \u2026roscoes wetsuit the boy: everyone else was  notice how the script mentions roscoes wetsuit after sasha asks the boy the question could it be a symbol of how the boy is unsure of his place unsure if he wants to go in the water but in a wetsuit because everyone else is in life just as he is unsure of the term which continues to be mentioned throughout the script. when the boy wakes up in the hospital this is the conversation he has with the nurse  white guy nurse: youre friends brought you in- the boy: theyre not my friends white guy nurse: i dont think theyd like you saying that the boy: doesnt matter. its the truth. but also they know. were not friends. theres a mutual benefit to our relationship but i cant trust them for shit  this kind of emphasises the point about the boy not really knowing his place in life  the alternative is that its a symbol of how things on the internet affect people and cause people to tweet and retweet something they dont truly understand. when the term was being thrown around on twitter no one knew what it meant but people still tweeted and retweeted it nonetheless.  seem to support this  never forget this feeling never gonna reach a million eventually all my followers realize they dont need a leader stay on your own shit fuck what these clones think just remember that you the shit but act like it dont stink  the line seems to imply that we dont need to be tweeting and retweeting what others are saying. donald the leader wants his followers to realise they dont need him and should stay on their own shit and ignore what the clones think/say/do  i just get the information retweeted or say it sucks  for this line rap genius sums it up perfectly: hes just passing on what others are saying. hes just a vessel for culture. instead of creating culture the internet just enables people to respond and pass on culture rather than create it themselves.  i think this is the best theory for what roscoes wetsuit is. that or the boy is actually called roscoe and his wetsuit is fucking dope  last thing on the wetsuit: on tumblrs irl childish gambino feature which features a real-life recreation of his characters bedroom there is a wetsuit beside the bed. interesting. is the boys name roscoe  "]}
