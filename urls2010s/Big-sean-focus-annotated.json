{"big sean": ["  focus  focus can be the difference between on and off winning and losing good and great between great and the best  focusing could be the most self-fulfilling thing you could do for yourself because with focus comes accomplishment focusing could bring out your greatest talents and give you true purpose in this world it can take your natural ability and magnify it to extraordinary one thing i learned and im sure most of us know is what you focus on what you put your energy into is exactly what we should expect back thats just the law of the universe  karma i seen it happen like 10000 times it is proven that 1+1 being two  focus is the key to being successful in any situation if you focus on the wrong youll get the wrong things theres no way to focus on one thing and expect something different how you focus on something is giving attention to it even if you dont like it and still focus on not liking it youre still putting your attention to it and will still attract it  for example if you focus on wanting a new car youll keep attracting the idea of wanting a new car but it is easy to confuse that because wanting a new car isnt the way to manifest it youre simply just wanting a new car and not obtaining a new car remember the intent of your focus is so important theres a difference between focusing on wanting a new car and focusing on a car being yours we really should be clear on what we focus on  honestly i feel like time is the most valuable thing we have ever been given and focus runs parallel to that because every second of the day were focused on something whether you realize it or not i for sure am a victim of focusing on the wrong things sometimes i spent a little too much time on my phone looking at comments focusing on how itd feel a little too long but thats just human  its very rare that youd probably focus on 100% of your time on what you need to but the biggest advantage is to quickly catch yourself and be able to reset your focus for me theres no way i could focus on something i dont love at least not for long  im just not content with my spending my life miserable and i just personally cant live like that it is not a party of vibration you could tell how you feel your inner guidance system your feelings if i feel good im doing the right thing if not then its not what im supposed to be doing  how does what you focus on makes you feel remember its never too late or too early to know what makes you happy and to make that change by any means necessary i went into my last album focused i wanted to focus on making music that would change peoples lives help lift their moods up music that i felt that was undeniably great to me and talk about what directly affected me and thats what i did i never focused so much on executing these things while making music and whatd you know my first number one album and my most successful one yet  you cant measure success by anything but happiness i say that all the time and if you focus your energy on what makes you happy what do you think will happen exactly it always work out  rewire any thoughts you had prior and know that you are what you focus on  focus  "]}
