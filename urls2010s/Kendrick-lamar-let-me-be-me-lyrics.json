can tell a story that the whole world can feel like the ones that came before me knowing that im misunderstood so i gotta get my point across like a snitch would and i would never walk in the shadow that never was really there or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair and dave said he proud of my newfound honesty and all i could say is will the radio care yeah or should i say no or should i just stop and come with a whole new approach you heard my hip-hop when i was 16 years old well that was me then now im an adult 22 like the smallest of guns that you know most determined but with the smallest of funds to show but im not worried my talent should take me places ive never been the world should turn as soon as my records spin i wanna be the highest on top of all the bullshit the
