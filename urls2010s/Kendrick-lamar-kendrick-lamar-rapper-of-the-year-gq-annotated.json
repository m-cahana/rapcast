{"kendrick lamar": ["  reminder that you can click the images for more annotations.  every member of raps mount rushmore dropped new albums in 2013\u2014kanye jay z drake eminem\u2014but it was another mc altogether who stole the crown and he did it with just a handful of verses: kendrick lamar the latest\u2014and possibly greatest\u2014rapper to come straight outta compton.   we are 10000 feet above compton in a private jet and kendrick lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday when he vanished. we had a plan: kendrick was going to give me a guided cue-the-g-funk-synth star maps tour of his neighborhood the one he still more or less lives in starting at his parents house a couple of blocks from his old high school centennial high near the corner of piru and south central. instead he went awol. the whole day no one from his label interscope or top dawg entertainment the baby death row records that originally signed him could track him down. kendrick was gone.  it turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his little bro\u2014a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. a few weeks earlier chad keaton 23 had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to kendricks parents house. he held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.  so today here on board this challenger 300 seven-seater en route to new york citys fall fashion week a destination filled with people kendrick isnt sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with hes telling me about chad. it all happened when i was overseas he says. i had to talk to him over skype on the hospital bed before he passed.  its been a strange year. when it began kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds\u2014one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever\u2014and since then his legend has spread fast.  it actually began late last year when kendricks major-label-debut album good kid m.a.a.d citydropped to universal acclaim. the album\u2014about a day in the life of nerdy compton teenager k.dot and his homeys as they run around in his moms minivan chasing that crazy-ass girl sherane\u2014is practically a black ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster raps violent tropes and a celebration of its signature slow-rolling sound. on good kid lamar is our embedded correspondent spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. hes the games most linguistically cerebral mc but also its realest\u2014the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dudes house\u2014and its this polarity that makes listening to king kendrick feel like youre putting on the illest 3-d glasses in hip-hop. the music nods at influences far beyond the west coast\u2014beach house samples dungeon family lushness\u2014but throughout his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around central avenue and piru street: if pirus and crips all got along theyd probably gun me down by the end of this songgood kid m.a.a.d city sold an industry-shocking 241000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. then in august kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar trojan horse into his buddy big seans song control\u2014a guest spot on a song that didnt even make the final record. after big sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in detroit kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: drake; a$ap rocky; j. cole; tyler the creator; even big sean himself. the dude slaps sean on his own song. he also proclaimed himself the king of new york which to certain east coast ears sounded like a greek dude strolling into troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of hector.  control leaked on youtube late in the day on august 12; for a solid week it was the biggest story in music. just a few weeks after that kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be kendrick lamar.  kendricks career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30000 feet. chad keatons memorial service was held just before labor day weekend; kendrick attended then flew straight to a show in alaska. next it was on to vegas to perform at a pool party. he only made it back to the set to grieve for a single day the day we were scheduled to talk. it can be complicated and confusing kendrick says of his life right now funerals for murdered friends one day private jets to fashion parties the next. from my perspective its not just im famous\u2014i still live in this world. and when someone back home needs something i still gotta get that phone call.  its clear the emotions are still raw. kendrick is a small guy just five feet six and with his black hood pulled up over his head a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt it felt like i was talking to a wizened rap jedi. after about an hour of questions i gave him a break and he lay down on the couch to rest. just kind of curled up with his back turned.  a bit later i saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: when the cameras stop rolling it doesnt mean real life will follow. instantly it had fifty-six retweets. after one minute 600. after two minutes 1000. then he tweeted a picture of chad: rest n heaven my lil bro. watched u become a man. u fought bro. the city stole yo life but not your legacy.   on the night of the 2013 mtv video music awards just as the heat over control was peaking i tailed kendrick through the backstage maze at brooklyns barclays center. at one point he ran into drake and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. it was their first encounter since kendrick called him out on control and of all the slaps in that verse this one felt the most personal because drake had helped break kendrick handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. after drakes vma performance of hold on were going home kendrick made his way back to the greenroom crooning the hook: i got my eyes on you.... he caught mine and smiled. you watch he joked im going to be singing by my fifth album  i asked if this meant things were cool between him and drake. he paused. pretty cool. shrugs. and i mean i would be okay if we werent.  a month later it became apparent that things between kendrick and drake were definitely not cool. after drakes new album dropped he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the control thing: you cant just say that and then see me and be like yeah man whats up\u2014pretending like nothing ever happened. seemingly in response during the bet hip-hop awards cypher a few weeks later kendrick freestyled: nothing been the same since they dropped control / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.  i got kendrick on the phone after the bet taping and he admitted to being surprised by drizzys public lash-out\u2014control named names sure but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers kendrick actually gives a shit about. most of them took it in that spirit. not drake. yeah i guess he took it as a dis kendrick said downplaying talk of a beef. but he was also clear that he doesnt look up to drake doesnt see him as any kind of creative influence. when i asked if drake was a mentor or a role model he replied quickly no\u2014peer. if anything. we all peers.   when kendrick lamar was 21 2pac appeared to him in a vision. before you roll your eyes lamar wants you to know that hes not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-nitrian-desert vision-seeing type. he knows how this sounds.  i was coming from a late studio session sleeping on moms couch. im 26 now\u2014it wasnt that long ago. i remember being tired tripping from the studio lying down and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of pac talking to me. weirdest shit ever. im not huge on superstition and all that shit. thats what made it so crazy. it can make you go nuts. hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying dont let the music die. hearing it clear as day. clear as day. like hes right there. just a silhouette.  the visit from pac changed kendricks connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. it wasnt just about money hoes clothes drinkin he explains. i mean i come from that world but at the same time i started to realize that theres people out there that cant really connect to that lifestyle. theyre in the struggle.  much of kendricks music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment about somehow gaining control over his households chaos\u2014some of his uncles were crips and his father was reportedly a gangster disciple in chicago before moving to compton\u2014and over his neighborhoods warped commitment to adolescent pride. its an ethos that extends to his crew. they have a seriousness of purpose a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. kendrick doesnt smoke weed or drink booze. in the time i spent with him i never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay nor did i see kendrick so much as glance at the many many girls around him. when i ask ogs why theres so much division in the streets\u2014nobody never really knows he says. but you know one thing that everybody always mention a woman.  a few hours after the vmas we were back in kendricks hotel room and everybody was in a lull staring at cell phones waiting for news about afterparties. a plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by diddy at the dream downtown hotel. but one of kendricks top dawg boys leaned back and said aw man i cant go to no club.  kendrick spoke up.  we have to go.  look at you we have to go. youre never we have to go.  you know me kendrick explained. i only go when theres a point. usually the point is just niggas drinking. but walking through the club the week after i released the control verse thats a point  twenty minutes later anthony top dawg tiffith basically tdes suge knight asked if i had had a fun day. i said that i had and that i was surprised by their discipline. you guys seem so calm i said.  well tiffith told me were going to have to call it a night with you because we about to get uncalm. you understand. the gossip from diddys ciroc amaretto launch party/vma afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-90s west coast-east coast time wave. bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati\u2014jay bey\u2014mouths agape as a wasted diddy incensed by the king of new york boast attempted to pour a drink ciroc amaretto presumably over kendricks head only to be thwarted by jay z acolyte j. cole who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. naturally kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. it was all love at that party he told me on the private jet.  after we land at teterboro airport in new jersey i catch a ride with kendrick into manhattan. his show tonight is a new york fashion week kickoff party in chelsea thrown by industry doyenne jenn\u00e9 lombardo and in the car he goofs around imagining the horror he and his compton homeys could inspire: we invited kendrick lamar not k.dot and them piru niggas.  by the end of his forty-minute set the crowd is pretty fucked-up. theres chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. when kendrick launches into the call-and-response for swimming pools drank a song about his familys dark relationship with chemical dependency\u2014head shot. drank. sit down. drank. stand up. drank\u2014a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. there is something demonic about the scene: kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent fashion week party.  its hard to guess how scenes like this will change kendrick and his music. sometime in january he will step into top dawgs booth again and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. i dont know he says. it depends on where my emotion is. how angry ill be or how happy ill be or how confused ill be.  at one point on good kid kendrick raps i can feel the changes / i can feel a new life / i always knew life can be dangerous. the biggest change in kendricks life is the inversion of raps consummate observer becoming the observed. how will all eyez on him affect his art because hes already 10000 feet above compton and rising.
