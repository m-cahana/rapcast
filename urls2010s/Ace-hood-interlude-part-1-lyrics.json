{"ace hood": ["", "  intro: trust the process trust the process trust the process  : i think the main thing for me was trying to decide on who am i like what i wanna be and how i wanna be remembered like that was my thing like you know often times i think about like my legacy and like the mark that i wanna leave not only on the industry but the effect that i wanna leave on people being a whole human being going through my obstacles going through the things that im going through and not to only broadcast these things but for it to inspire change think that was like my main thing and the reason why i made the decision that i made parting ways from the whole we the best thing i had a different vision i seen something larger for myself you know we werent necessarily seeing eye-to-eye on some things so i decided to do my own thing its not what you go through its how you go through it and i think that i chose to deal with this with grace as many times as i wanted to blow up about the situation and get mad and fire off on somebody i just thought to myself like what if i handle this shit with love man like you know what ever you put out to the universe comes back you know if you put out positive energy you get positive back if you put out negative energy you get the negative back today i feel like this was the best decision ive ever made in my life as a man taught me a lot as a father you know as a boss as a ceo the world was asking so many things with me like you have to be this you gotta be this now and i didnt know how to be and im still not perfect im still trying to figure it out still trying to find my thing but im open to it and im ready for it as real as my music i really try to get out all of me i wanna give the fans the realness of me and what ive been dealing with good thing happen - thank god bad thing happen - thank god cause thats lessons thats lessons in everything in life in every single thing and i think that its just all on us to whether we choose to learn from that or we allow that to be our downfall and i could never let any other outside voices get to me  outro: trust the process trust the process trust the process  "]}
