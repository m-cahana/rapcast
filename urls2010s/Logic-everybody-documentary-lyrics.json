{"logic": [" one thing i think id like to say and you could maybe even start the whole shit off with this is... im not sorry for making this album and i made this album from a place in my heart of love... and im black and im proud as shit. thats the shit thats the thing the whole world said i could never say or be or do. and im biracial and i love my fans. swag. flex. rattpack  ", "  ", " cmon is it going alright whats up guys this is day one of recording for the i mean *claps* hey whats up guys. make sure you keep that last part in there of me explaining it because were real all the time. rattpack my studio is being built  ", "  ", " logic: *tapping on glass* bobby campbell: *tapping his foot* what are you going to contribute 6ix: *claps*  ", " that was the first song ever created in this room  ", " yeah thats the first beat ever damn to 6ix: but like whats it like from going to whats going to be in here from charles hall  ", " oh nuts. its gon- its the come up. its the glow up. its what weve always wanted  ", " uh well the message for the music is just equality of man. straight up. straight up and down. 6 oclock. when white people find out that im black racist white people. they treat me on some like-and ive heard this send your ass back to africa or at least the half that doesnt matter. shit like that that ive heard. its like thats what i am im either one or the other to these people. theres like just a handful no more than i think like 4 songs where i am truly discussing being biracial in america. with that being said those are the only times i discuss race and its my race. not your race or his race or her race its just me being biracial and telling my story. and you might not like my story but its my story you know and then the entire rest of the album is rapped you know from different perspectives of a life that that dude atom who is being reincarnated has lived  ", " theres a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is atom. atom but like the first man right but spelled a-t-o-m like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. he gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. and hes talking to this random guy. and the guys like life whats it all about and hes like what what the fuck you talkin about hes like where am i well it turns out the random guy is actually god. have you ever heard of this guy named neil degrasse tyson scientist scientist astrophysicist crazy super awesome and i dont know how the hell i did it but i got him to play the role of god on my album. which is crazy  ", " i cant even believe that neil degrasse tyson is on this album. like when i think about it thats like the most gangster feature of all time  ", " logic: so what now what advice can you give me neil: what advice can i give humanity  ", " you guys know big von hes like the radio dj from the bay on kmel  ", " oh yeah  ", " so he plays this guy named atom  ", " big von: wait wait wait what stop all the hippie shit  ", " this guy atom dies and its a whole conversation between them. and he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. and then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. and he has been reincarnated so many times in fact that he is every human being that has ever existed. you know he was jesus and all of his disciples. he was hitler and everybody that he murdered. you know every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone he was doing it to himself. every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone he was only doing it onto himself. and it isnt until he has lived in the shoes of ever man woman child race religion color creed and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. so every time im rapping on the album pretty much im rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. so its very sci-fi but its very real at the same time. its weird man its a good one  ", " hip-hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from who they were and you know he has a lot of imagination  ", " i was actually really inspired when i read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of andy weir called the egg. i read it and it inspired me so much and its essentially the same thing its just my take on it. you know its a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. and i thought wow i relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. i kind of feel that. i feel kind of what what its like to be two people. to be like a black man in a fair skinned body if that makes any sense. so its like wow its almost like living two separate lives to the public. not to me but to others.  they might view me as different people. i guess wow thats crazy i never really thought of it like that  ", " so bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy sci-fi thats the difficult thing to score  ", " i didnt think i was going to be able to pull it off. i mean how do you pull off that how do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived who is actually everyone ever. its just crazy but i dont know how the hell it came together but it did  ", "  ", " this is so much more than just music. its like a true personal part of my life. so im getting my license im doing my best to get fit and in shape and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. and dealing with my music and friends wife personal relationship and dogs and everything. so i just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see  ", " so yesterday i think i was telling mike that i had the wildest anxiety ever. in my mind i was like im like im fine im fine i dont know why but i was feeling physically weird. not like ill or anything just like- faint. you know kind of dizzy kind of out of it. very disconnected  ", " fan: logic logic: sup dude fan: whats going on man hows you day logic: nice i got an appointment. whats your name man fan: raymond logic: *shakes his hand* nice to meet you raymond raymond: you have a great day logic: thanks brother  ", " yeah thats a big thing that ive been dealing with so much which is like anxiety. a lot of people dont understand it and thats why im like having you document this right now because i want to invite everybody into my life like never before and i have severe anxiety and its hard and it sucks  ", "  ", " its just so crazy because ive always-like im on my shit you know what i mean like im on my shit and i know what i need to do and how i need to do things but then anxiety can step in and be like you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that but im gonna fuck you up. like its weird its crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. its a mental thing that can affect you physically and thats why when i had the biggest panic attack i ever had last year you know just after the incredible true story was made i was convinced i was going through was a physical thing. i was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. like you know what i mean cause my body was so fucked up and um its not that. its my mind. its anxiety  ", "  ", " when i went in the booth and i knew all of you guys were all out there listening and i was learning it there and then on the spot what he wanted me to sing. damn my legs were shaking i was so nervous it was the first time i sung it and i guess thats when you really-like i realized that hes got a vision and i have to trust it because i wanted to practice it and get better at it he comes back in and i was like i wanna know i want to capture how you are right now when youre singing this for the first time  ", " i think thats good ah  ", " the first time in my life i have done anything like that  ", " you never  ", " im not really sure how it goes  ", " now listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i dont know if that would have been the same if i had learnt it  ", "  ", "  ", " yo making music makes me feel good man. like when im here with you guys like not to sound any type of way a lot of thati mean i still be feelin weird but a lot of it goes away. its like i have purpose with you guys  ", " hold on im trying to think... one sec. should it end with the hook or maybe-maybe thats not the hook. maybe i keep going right now and then i bring the hook again... thats what ill do i will extend this verse...  ", "  its always really hard to recreate a vibe because i was in such a zone the other night. i have to tap back into that same energy. its gotta be the same  ", "  alright no no. can you pause it i fucking hate technology. pause it pause it pause it pause it pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing my fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. fucking hate this shit  i think this is harder than when i did gang related.  ", "  let me hear that... woo  ", " so i need you to bring it back so it sounds really good you know you gotta make it like you gotta make my vocals pop period. like im going here and this breaks like you gotta feel it in your soul. as the engineer you need to know what youre doing. ", " you know what im saying gotta be really good  ", " i lost my job to bart simpson  ", " yeah youre fucking out bro  driving i was with no i.d. yesterday hadent seen him for a while. and we just had a real good talk. man to man shot some pool  ", " we shoot pool and i just want it know i won 3 games today. camera man: hes gonna edit that out it doesnt matter... when you edit this just know... 3-0  ", " just out of nowhere then i played him my album. and he loved it  ", " my thoughts were just by far his best work for me  ", " and i asked him to rap on it and he said yeah  ", " i mean i can- i can rap  ", " no i.d. is going to rap on my album. which is like what thats so unheard of  ", " i havent really recorded a song in 20 years  ", " i texted j.cole and i was like yo deons rapping on my album no i.d. and he was like what how the fuck did you get him to do that and i thought about it and i just asked him. only you could get him to do that  ive waited for this moment my whole life. right now nothing else matters. just making music here with deon  ", " the concept is how were all and whats going on in the native american community thats being ignored  ", "  ", " america so america came together you all were there. that shit was crazy. i just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and i was pressing them and i was throwing drums on and creating the pads  ", "  when i create music i hear sounds. distinct-- thats why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. they sing all the words because its catchy. all the sounds are catchy. first things you hear woo... thats the ohhhh  and it goes off  youll hear a switch up and then im just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and thats all he knows. and like thats a lot of my own experience like with my brothers and then my boy lenny is like helping me voice this youll hear it  ", "  ", " when logic approached me with the contributing to the song america he laid it out. he knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song  ", " we worked on the first album and i was the executive producer. and some of the first session into the album i pretty much knew he was a producer not just a rapper. i told him hey you dont really need me to produce your records because you have your ideas. you need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.

see things. you see a black man you see a middle eastern man you see... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and thats so fucked up and i hate  that. people look at me and i go im a rapper and they go what or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look or how i speak. oh you speak white or you talk white like the fuck ive heard that my whole life im saying in general for this career. what do you mean talk white what the fuck does that mean  i said fuck that why cant spiderman be black why cant james bon be gay why not like fuck it and thats why i open it up with black jesus black jesus. and people are like what black jesus what the fuck like ive got a black santa clause right now in my house  [booth session]  [logic] ive known damian for 6-7 years now maybe even 8 years. and weve just been buddies like through the internet. and we used to do records together. i wasnt shit i wasnt nobody. i knew i wanted him to be on the album and he dropped everything to come out here. with no promise of placement or anything like that just to see where he could contribute. and im sitting down there and were working and im like i think i need some vocals on here. and like i said i trust everybody who knows whats going to happen you want to go in there and lets see what you got. he told me before bobby hit record that you could hear it in the microphone his heart pumping  [damian lemar hudson] and like i could just feel the magnitude of this moment. and how pivotal it was  [logic] he was like this is 6 years in the making that just came out. and...  [damian] i dont know something just hit me and i started letting loose  [damian in the booth]  [damian] something about that some type of [] grabbed me and let me soar vocally  [logic while listening] yes praise him im putting this on the album get in here right now to damian. come here  [logic] you just earned yourself a feature credit  [damian] it was like one of those milestones in your career where you know youre just in the right room and the right mind state. everything just lined up  [logic] i only work with people that are as good and creative as i am in their field. i like when people make me feel fucking stupid. i like  when people are so good at playing strings or piano or singing or whatever that makes me feel talentless. i cant do what they do. like im batman. im player 1 im super mario so are you guys behind the camera so is 6ix. i dont work with player 2s i dont work with robins. i work with other batmen and i know that sounds really weird but what i mean by that is you whenever you leave and you take this camera to do whatever you do you are a boss. youre a boss and you go do boss shit. but when youre with me youre under my wing being a boss helping me paint my boss-ass picture  [c-sick] with logic time to go to the basement. its my time to shine. hopefully i have something that actually like fit on the project  [mos definitely interlude]  [c-sick] when i first met [] i could see this []  [logic in the booth]  [killer mike] i mean hes a superior lyricist. we already know that. he puts together classic albums we know that. this is beautiful its rich its moody it revs you up and brings you down. its an album and in an age where that may not be important its refreshing. you know so bravo ive told him before i think hes one of the best in the world  [logic] mannnn come on. thanks man  [lucy rose] logics music makes me feel something. i dont listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. and when i first met bobby he did ask me  why do you listen to my music like i dont understand. like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music. but theres something about it i just cant explain but it makes me really feel something  [logic] its kind of scary. i cant explain. like when i first started making music i was willing to sacrifice everything because i had nothing to lose. but now i have everything to lose. that isnt a bad thing. that just means i have a good life  it makes me work harder. because i was working so hard to obtain all of this. but now i have to work even harder to keep it ooooo i just gave you some fire  with my last album i went around to radio stations and i shook hands and i jerked people off. and i was like yeah whats up trying to get radio placements. but not like trying to work for the radio but like trying to get more people to hear. and  this time im like fuck that shit. im not going nowhere im not doing any press. this album has already done what it was intended to do and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. it did what it was intended to do because i dont give a shit what anybody else thinks  and im really not gonna try to get too much into it but i had a conversation with j.cole about the public and being on social media and all these things. like i dont need the public to accept me. i dont need anybody to tell me my music is great or im amazing. because i know im good i know im great and i know im amazing. just like you and them so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because i know im good and thats what this album is about. knowing that youre beautiful youre great and youre special. knowing that you are something were something and will be something  so fuck everybody else  [credits]  "]}
