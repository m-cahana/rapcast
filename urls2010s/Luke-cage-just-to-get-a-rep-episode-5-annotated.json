scarfe: oh yeah wise guy well how about this whats going on between you and cottonmouth  luke: he didnt like the way i was washing dishes and he fired me.  misty: chaos rolls off you like water off a

what would you do  shades: sell this club. you can net three mil easy on the real estate alone.  cottonmouth: not happening. no one black has ever done anything like this. percy sutton came close but that was years ago. harlems paradise is special. and its not going nowhere.  shades: if you dont make the right moves now you are done.  cottonmouth: this place is my reputation. my blood. my legacy.  luke cage walks into the club and carefully drapes his suit jacket over a chair.  cottonmouth: hes here.  some minions advance on luke.  luke: you guys again  cottonmouth from above: there he is. dishwasher lazarus. you want your old job back costs to be a savior. ask jesus.  luke: you started all this. this is me finishing it.  cottonmouth: you want harlem its expensive.  luke: i dont want harlem. i just want you to stop messing with it. this is my home. you dont know a damn thing about it.  the minions attack luke with first fists then guns. shades finally recognizes him.  shades: carl lucas  luke: its called deductive reasoning. if a rocket launcher couldnt stop me whats that little peashooter gonna do  cottonmouth: you wanna go to war hmm ill take you to war.  luke: you dont have enough people. this mobs not deep enough. ask your man shades.  shades: youre supposed to be dead.  cottonmouth: you cant kill me.  luke to cottonmouth: keep my name out your mouth.  cottonmouth: or what  luke leaves without answering.  cottonmouth: you know this son of a bitch  shades: its a long story.  cottonmouth: ill make time.  soledads diner  claire is playing with a salt shaker.  soledad: dont do that.  claire: what worried im gonna spill it mami youre so superstitious.  soledad: and youre not  claire: theres more to this than superstition.  soledad: thats a kind of yes/no thing.  claire: theres a middle ground. unexplainable. the hospital was attacked by men in masks. and the one i took down had a scar like from an autopsy. like he had died and come back to life once before. and his friends broke in and killed louisa. the hospital wants to cover it up. theyre saying that a junkie stabbed louisa. i was gonna go to the cops so they gave me a choice. actually it wasnt a choice at all.  soledad: im glad you came home.  claire: i kinda had to. metro-general pretty much made sure i cant work anywhere else in new york.  soledad: what would make you happy  claire: ive seen a man a blind man who can see because his other senses are so amplified. and this other man who survived a shotgun blast to his head and recovered from a brain hemorrhage in a few hours. and they both needed my help. i think thats what i want to do. is help people with abilities.  soledad: you know what your abuela said about these things  claire: well you know i dont believe in that santer\u00eda mumbo jumbo.  soledad: she was a curandera not a priestess. the world isnt the world anymore mija. aliens coming out of the sky. people with silver hammers. green monsters. all i know is everything happens for a reason. and now somehow youre a part of it. what do you call that  claire: the worst luck in the world.  soledad: its called fate.  cottonmouths office  shades: thats carl lucas. i did time with him at seagate prison when i first got there. rackham captain of the guards he had us work him over real good. theres no way he couldve survived in one piece.  cottonmouth: this niggas half houdini half ali.  shades: theres a bullet for everyone. diamondback taught me that. say what  shades: i got something to show you.  shades puts something up on the tv screen. one man in a bulletproof vest and another man pointing a gun at him.  cottonmouth: russian  shades: ukrainian i think. eastern european connection.  cottonmouth: kevlar  shades: must have a south american hookup. its heavy duty. military grade.  the man holding the gun shoots. the man in the vest jumps but stays standing.  cottonmouth: this aint shit.  shades: wait for it. wait for it.  theres a whirring noise and the bullet hole in the mans vest starts to smoke then the mans middle explodes and splatters blood everywhere.  cottonmouth laughs and whoops.  cottonmouth: that is the illest shit ive ever seen in my life are you serious  shades:based on a prototype by hammer. the rounds are a composite invisible to metal detectors. and they incinerate forensic evidence so they are untraceable.  cottonmouth: what kind of metal does that  shades: nothing from this earth.  cottonmouth: the incident  shades: thats what i hear. yo if you wanted to kill jesus thats the bullet youd use. thats why they call it the judas.  cottonmouth: hmm i can think of a few fools id love to baptize with that joint. how do i get em  shades: one of two ways: you pay for it or you ask diamondback to handle carl lucas for you.  cottonmouth: i dont need diamondback to handle my problems. how much for the damn thing  shades writes a number down on a coaster.  cottonmouth: per bullet  shades: mmm-hmm.  cottonmouth: for real god damn it. diamondback can front me. im good for it.  shades: he aint gonna front you a dime. you made too many mistakes.  cottonmouth: he told you that  shades: does he have to  cottonmouth: ill call him my damn self.  shades: he aint the same diamondback. if he does you this favor hes taking harlem from you. im just letting you know.  cottonmouth: ill get domingo his guns square everything away so diamondback can front me the loan. then ill kill cage so shit can get back to normal. let me make a few phone calls.  shades: my man.  the stationhouse  perez and captain audrey are looking at mistys photo wall.  misty: hey captain.  perez:we need to talk seriously.  misty: whats the problem  captain:  scarfe. iab hasnt officially said anything but someone i trust is telling me hes under investigation.  misty: what look ive been riding with scarfe for years. is he salty yeah. but dirty never.  perez: we have a lot of eyes on us misty. cant take any chances.  misty: whats this based on  captain: the night of the restaurant explosion and crispus attucks raid you and your partner logged into the crime scene 40 minutes apart.  misty: so  captain: in the time that was unaccounted for your only source of information for the barber shop shooting chico diaz went missing. he was last seen with scarfe.  misty: thats not true. scarfe left the precinct to pick up chico but chico was gone.  captain: so he picks up a witness unsupervised which is against protocol doesnt even log it in and he still has time to get to genghis connies before anyone else. what is he clairvoyant  perez: hes not telling you everything.  misty: look they are wasting their time on this.  scarfe: good news. gyro guys back. got your nasty mystery meat for you. veggie for me. captain lt. yall hitting on my partner again  perez: shes fair game when you aint around.  captain: let me know when you have something that uh we might be able to use detective.  scarfe: what was that about  misty: luke cage. they think were losing sight of cottonmouth by focusing on him.  scarfe: thats what happens when you start hawking raffle tickets in your own precinct. you forget how to do police work.  misty: hey. when i get back from the memorial you good with going over all the shit thats gone down since crispus attucks  scarfe: sure. ill get started while youre gone. go say goodbye to your friend.  scarfes desk phone rings.  scarfe: scarfe. yeah got it.  jackie robinson park  zip and some other minions are playing dice in the park.  luke: damn. you guys actually take lunch breaks like real employees huh any of you guys at crispus attucks the other night  everyone besides zip decides to leave.  zip: like i need these bitches.  zip take out his gun and fires at luke a few times with predictable results.  luke: aishas ring. you got it think about where you are. its hallowed ground this park. named for jackie robinson. its here. its all around you if you respect yourself enough to take a look.  zip: at what  luke: our legacy.  luke reaches into zips pocket and finds aishas ring.  the street  scarfe meets perez on a park bench.  perez: i dont know what the hell youve been doing but ias onto you and theyve given the captain a heads-up. youre being investigated scarfe. captain was poking around misty seeing what she knows. but weve got bigger problems than ia. cottonmouth needs domingos guns from evidence.  now.  scarfe: goddamn cottonmouth.  perez: what do you suggest  scarfe: itd be easier just to kill him.  perez: not really. we dont know if hes got a backup plan.  scarfe: you better have a backup plan for getting them guns.  perez voiceover: i got sergeant macclean from property on it.  onscreen the aforementioned macclean authorizes the disposal of the guns and loads them up into a van.  scarfe: macclean that fat donut-eating bastard is gonna get us burnt.  perez: well be fine. hes on payroll. if we go down he goes down.  the baseball paraphernalia store.  luke: aisha i got something for you.  aishas not there. instead luke sees her father with a can of colt 45.  eddie: you with them stickup boys  luke: no.  eddie: good. cause we aint got shit left.  luke: im sorry about what happened to your shop.  eddie: back in the days people had respect. i seen em all come and go. nicky. fritz. azie. its always been wild. but people carried groceries for old ladies. your name meant something.  luke: maybe thats why they call it back in the day. youre eddie  eddie:  the one and only.  luke: i need to find your daughter.  eddie: she still carrying on about that ring it aint worth shit.  luke: maybe it reminds her of better times...back in the day. what about your father did he play the game  eddie: of course. baseball is a game passed from father to son. thats why you dont see no niggas playing the game no more. cause all the fathers is gone. aishas the one had the idea for this damn shop. said i could sign some autographs and keep my hands on something positive. i said baby everything i touch turns to shit. she never did listen.  luke takes the can out of eddies hand and sets it down.  luke: quit letting her down. if she comes back tell her luke cage came by. i need to see her.  eddie picks the can up again.  eddie: you him huh your name is all over harlem today. not in a good way.  luke: im about to change that. you should do the same.  soledads diner  claire is flipping through a medical textbook. she sees lukes face on the news as her mother puts down a cup of coffee.  claire: thats him.  soledad: who  claire: luke.  soleda: oh hes trouble. he reminds me of your father.  diner: yo thats luke cage.  claire: you know him  diner: yeah. from the barber shop. hes for real.  the barbershop  luke comes in and sees his bullethole-ridden shirt in the mirror.  luke: shit...sorry pop. you got me.  he drops a dollar in the swear jar.  mount olivet - pops funeral  misty aisha shades and cottonmouth all sit down. aisha looks shifty.  cottonmouth sends a text from the church. across town scarfe is with the guns. he takes out his phone. a text from charlie mack says: you have my merch scarfe types yes but he doesnt send it. he closes up the van with the guns and drives away.  back at the church aisha has a gun. everyone turns to look at luke as he walks down the center aisle. he sits down next to aisha.  pops son: i never really knew my father. i always said that outside of my conception he was never there for me. it got easier and easier to think of him as dead. and now that he is i need him. more than ever. i was gonna tell him ive got one on the way. hes a grandfather. i just hope that by being in my sons life im able to do the things that seems like pop did for everybody else.  luke: aisha. i took care of it. you dont have to do anything else. and take your hand out of your purse.  aisha removes her hand. luke crushes the gun in her bag.  minister: would anyone else like to say anything  luke makes to stand.  cottonmouth: i have a few words. henry hunter was my mentor and oldest friend. taught me streets the hard way. yall dont remember the sound of his fist but thats how he got his name. pop. but he changed. he evolved. you see harlem would do that to you. where some people saw a war zone pop always saw a pasture. a breeding ground for artistry greatness. from billy strayhorn teddy riley big l a$ap rocky. all those brothers came from right here. roses from the concrete all cause of people like pop. now i believe that whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger. and thats how we got to look at pops death. now they never caught the shooter. but i have faith that he is rotting in the depths of hell. i miss pop. i promise you with all my might that even though we are being attacked from all sides by foreign interlopers strangers with arcane abilities i promise you i stay true to what we have right here. cause thats what pop woulda wanted.  sounds of agreement and applause. cottonmouth sits down and luke takes the pulpit. as he walks up he sees flashes of pops death.  luke: i asked pop once why he didnt want people to curse in his shop. and why we had to wear these ugly smocks. he said these kids need to see a man go to work every day and to be in the presence of men in uniform putting in work. i didnt want to walk in late but i was trying to do what pop always did. help those in need. and protect them from the forces that would do them harm. at first it was selfish because my name was attached to it. but then it got bigger. if we try to protect only ourselves without looking out for those people closest to us then we lose. pop never forgot his people. where some people saw hard rock kids he saw precious jewels. he reminded me that diamonds are formed by pressure covered in dirt. but then you polish them and they shine. pop saw the shine in everyone that walked in his barber shop. he cut their hair. he listened to their problems. and he made them feel better about the world and themselves. we have to strive on a daily basis to do the same for each other. and sometimes thats gonna mean standing up to a bully. especially if he calls himself a friend. talk about it. i dont believe in harlem. i believe in the people who make harlem what it is.  people stand up and applaud. luke hands aisha her fathers ring.  luke: i believe this belongs to you.  aisha: so youre one of them huh  luke: you mean someone who gives a damn yeah.  aisha and luke hug.  outside luke approaches cottonmouth and shades at their escalade.  luke: i was wrong. im glad you came. embarrassing you in public was much better than doing it behind closed doors in your cheap-ass club.  cottonmouth: never confuse the battle with the war.  luke:next suit that gets damaged im taxing you.  cottonmouth: laughing yes.  luke walks away as cottonmouth and shades get in their car. misty catches up with luke down the block.  misty: hell of an impression you made in there.  luke: im sorry did you just pay me a compliment  misty: no i didnt. you need to stop with this pissing contest before more people get killed.  luke: maybe if yall stopped him in the first place no one wouldve had to die.  misty: i will get him the right way. the system will win.  luke: forget the system. arrests lead to indictments. and indictments lead to pleas. theres always a bigger fish a bigger angle. a slap on the wrist. boom. right back in business. i aint going for that.  misty: you just started world war iii in there. and your ass might be bulletproof but harlem aint. harlem is gonna suffer. so if you arent gonna help us take him down then you need to leave right now luke before you make things worse.  luke: im sorry things couldnt be different between us. but i aint going nowhere.  luke goes down into the barbershop and turns on the lights.
