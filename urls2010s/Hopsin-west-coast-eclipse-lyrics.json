{"hopsin": ["", "   when i rap i like to seem wack at first and rhyme cheap words like curse and verse and once it passes like one or two bars i turn the switch on and start crushing fools hard who said the west isnt consistent im fixing to fix it for all these niggas who listening and living imprisoned im thinkin it isnt missing its villain killing them image now imma rip this now witness it as i finish the sentence losing hip-hop was a tragic loss but i found it and glued it right to my dick so if you want it youll have to jack it off rappers acting soft as a fabric cloth imma smash em all their nuts are like berries mines are the size of basketballs i choke mcs out with a strong vice grip then beat them with the sticks from the cross that they hung christ with head to the club then pull me a sprung white chick you all know how hop gets down he one nights it i sleep walk at night with a bunch of madness mob through the halls and talk with a russian accent ready to kill like im a real thug assassin who beat my dads ass and wake up like nothing happened im ruthless and i do drop bombs i got fools in the valley like dude nuh-uh when my album drops make sure that you cop one we need a raw fool like me since 2pacs gone wack rappers like hop ill disable you in the booth im like for real thats a fatal attempt to do you thinking you spit the truth i shake you and strip your jewels then hang you up from a roof and strangle you with a noose cremate you with four torches flame of the torch scorching leaving your corpse tortured of course its hardcore shit and if theres ever a day that my pockets hurting im robbing you with a osama bin laden turban hip-hop is urging for a new flock of verses to rock the circuit all you flops emerging are pitiful we did not deserve it your style aint even worth the fame its watered down more than new orleans during a hurricane your whole album was a verbal shame im hopsin dont act like you aint heard the name  "]}
