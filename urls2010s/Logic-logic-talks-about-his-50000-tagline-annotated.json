{"logic": ["  logic: its a lyric in a song not gonna say what song where or what this that. but what i was saying in the original song i was trying to talk about my experience at lollapalooza. so when i was on my stage a whole sea of people came through at chicago and it was 50000 people in the crowd and i got a line that goes: check the instagram fam i got fifty-thousand people in the crowd singin out loud every word thats every lyric you can hateshit just stop actin like you dont hear itand for me when i was in the booth i trying to think of different cool ways to say fifty-thousand so i was like fifty-thousand people and i was like five-o-triple-o people done it and i was trying to flow right but i couldnt find it so i just ended up going with i got fifty thousand people in the crowd. but at the very end of the song it said five-o-triple-o at the end and it sounded like a really cool tag just like a dope kinda like production tag and so i left that on a couple of songs that i had and it kinda made it on flexicution. i wont talk about that so...hahaha.
