{"schoolboy q": [". i didnt have a top 40 record none of my singles went gold or platinum but yet if you look at my album its #1 in hip-hop right now and it hasnt even dropped yet. that says a lot. my fans are there and the energy is good. everything i do is for my fans. i aint shit without them.  bt: did you go into the studio intending to make a certain statement with this album  q: yeah. when i made this i ", " ima fuck niggas up. when i made this i planned on not having one single on the album. like not one. i just wanted to put it out.  bt: why are artists so anti single  q: im not anti single. im not one of them niggas that say aww record sales aint everything. no. i wanna sell good. i would love a platinum record on radio and charts but for this album i wanted to have it straight for my core fans for people to know where i come from and who i am because i may not ever do this type of music sonically again.  bt: over the last couple years youve developed a very carefree style of rhyming\u2013\u2013you use your voice like instruments often replacing words with noises. seems like you mastered that on collard greens. whats your writing process  q: im one dude that writes his adlibs. i dont just go in there and say gimme a track. i say what ima say here ", " i put effects on my voice. why not i wrote it. why not show the talent why be scared thats why i hate certain fans who hate cause its not like raw hip-hop like boom bap. cause its not boom bap or i stack the hook ", " its not hip hop i can do more than just boom bap. fuck that shit.  bt: i have to respect how you brand your rhymes. like some sentences dont even make sense off the first listen but you can tell its by artistic design.  q: i do say a lot of shit that people wouldnt understand because its like insider talk. thats how me and my homies talk. like how we pronounce certain words; we would call a beat a steat. so i would put that type of shit in my music and people wouldnt understand it but eventually if they stay down with me and they get to know me they will understand everything. i remember listening to sugar free and jay z and i never really understood some of the stuff they used to say until years later. then you hear it again like damn thats crazy. i just got what hes talking about.  bt: with titles like setbacks and habits & contradictions its clear youve always owned your rocky journey. was there a particular incident that made you say ive got to stop with the street shit and devote 100% to rap  q: it was various things. i couldnt sell pills no more ", " homie went to jail. so that connection was lost. the homie moved from the block so i couldnt just stay on the block no more. i was just dirt broke. my daughter mom was coming through giving me money every day just to get something to eat\u2013\u2013$10 dollars or whatever. i didnt have no where to stay. i went to tde and was literally living in the studio where you record. i went damn near a whole two years not getting sleep because there was always somebody there recording. i was taking baths with dishwashing liquid. i was one of the dudes ", " would never ask for nothing so i would never ask for soap. if i couldnt steal it i would just take a little dishwashing liquid and brush the dirt off me right quick.  bt: was top dawg ever like a big brother to you  q: it ended up being like that. at first i could tell they didnt really fuck with me. i was just cool ", " they didnt fuck with me musically. ", " they shouldnt have fucked with me at that time. i wasnt ready yet. but i kept staying around. punch seen something. the only person that seen something in me was punch and probably ab-soul. ab-soul and punch was the two niggas that was like yeah q gon be one of them niggas. watch. i dont know how they knew but they knew.  bt: you started out doing shows with kendrick. what was that early experience like  q: he wanted me to be his hype man. ", " his hype man i just seen so much: him jumping from nine people at the show to 30 people to 100 to 200 to 300 to sold out. that shit was motivation for me. kendrick was basically living how i was but he was staying with his mama. like we was grown men. he was living with his mama at 24 25 ", " talking about he gonna be a rapper. you know how that shit sounds you already past 21 and you still talking about ima be a rapper. you aint did one show niggas aint seen you on tv. so kendrick kind of went through the same thing i went through. he just had his moms house to go to.  bt: what kind of conversations did you and kendrick have after the grammy snubs  q: we was talking about it right before the grammys. he was at my mixing session ", " the album. kendrick is never one to\u2026hes not like me or like the average rapper that will be like nigga ima win ima talk shit if i was nominated for a grammy but hes not that ", " dude\u2013\u2013he a cool nigga. so we just talking and im like cuz you gon get one or two and he like yeah that shit could be crazy. sho nuff they didnt give my nigga one i was mad for a little bit. i went on a little rant on twitter and shit but we still gotta be grateful for everything. win or lose bro. we here.  bt: right. grateful youre not where yall used to be. you be mad for a minute\u2013\u2013were human\u2013\u2013but after that its like im straight. still accomplished so much. its niggas that aint never been nominated. people saying that you been robbed is almost better than winning a grammy. its so much more talk. shit im grateful for everything every obstacle that come my way. thats how he feel too. we just made a joke out of it. now its funny like nigga you lost  bt: as acclaimed as kendrick is its clear that he still has another plane to reach. same goes for you which is why i thought with your album about to drop you were gonna be a little more visible\u2013\u2013some features maybe pop up on kendricks nba all-star stage. were you low by design  q: yeah i let my music do the talking. aint no tv show gonna help me. aint no hit single gon help me sell no records. how many artists done came with a hit record and nobody cared for nothing else dont get me wrong i would definitely want a hit record but i still want the success to be around the album. only the music can help me. kendrick wasnt top 40 or none of that either before he dropped. he dropped his album and it blew up everywhere\u2013\u2013same with j. cole when he first came out. all these niggas that have good music have longevity. nas first album\u00ac\u00ac\u2013\u2013when niggas was goin two and three times platinum his shit went gold. just gotta do you.  bt: you recorded with one of your idols 50 cent. why wasnt he on the album  q: we did a couple records but they didnt work out. i wish i couldve had 50 on my album. hes like one of my biggest inspirations to do rap. i related to him a lot in his music. i remember\u2026this is what really made me wanna start rappin\u2026 i watched the beef dvd and i had just got out ", "\u2013\u2013i was trying to rap but i really wasnt fuckin with it it was just something to do\u2013\u2013and ", " was like if youre a felon who just got out of jail and you dont know what to do nigga rap. swear to god. go look when he was talking about ja rule and shit. i dont know what beef that was but they just let me out on house arrest. that probably was the moment you was asking about earlier.  bt: you said two years ago that you werent able to provide for your daughter. how does schoolboy q balance being gangster rapper and father to a little girl  q: im not really a gangster no more. im a gangster rapper. im just telling a story now. im speaking on past shit so its real easy. its tough not seeing her as much. thats the hard part. i know how i wanna raise my kid i know how i want her to grow up. i want her to be spoiled. why work so hard just to hold on to the money i dont plan on ever retiring. like retirement is not in my future. i never wanna have a time where im on the big lawn just sitting back smoking cigars and drinking lemonade. i wanna work forever. until i die. i wanna die on the way to a show. or like i ", "", "  schoolboy q waltzes through the entrance of the marlton hotels mini penthouse with energy opposite of his fans this nyc morning. the delivery date for his interscope debut oxymoron is less than two weeks away and rap heads even those on the opposite coast of his native los angeles are juiced with anticipation. q isnt juiced on anything. he soberly greets the awaiting collective of vibe editors video shooters stylists and single groomer. he sports a fuchsia tde hoodie beneath a grim three-quarter trench black hat that appears hasidic official and grips a styrofoam dunkin donuts cup. he claims his management never informed him of the need to change clothes. he has no desire to wear the italian dinner jackets that were pulled and the groomer shouldnt even think about getting near his rasta-esque beard. schoolboy doesnt shave. schoolboy also never takes his hat off. the room silently prays that his cup of joe is black.  then a blunt lights up and the rapper born quincy hanely follows. he doesnt want the room to perceive him as difficult. his music may articulate an unbridled crip who has more pills to sell and pop than fucks to give but hes quite clearheaded on the music and aesthetic he wants to put forth. he says hell shave one day. just not for the release of oxymoron. one listen to the south central audio trip and youll realize ignoring the album titles support schoolboys not nearly as dumb as his drug choices. like the best who ever recorded a full composition labelmate kendrick lamar included q brings you inside of his world. the exceptional arrives when he places oxy frames on your eyes so you can experience his grey south central story under the influence of insane highs and hues. tenured professors like pharrell and raekwon and alchemist and kurupt enable schoolboys miseducation in scholarly fashion. its why despite oxymoron leaking immediately after this shoot its healthy presales have encouraged murmurs of the rookies first week possibly outperforming rick rosss whose sixth album drops the following tuesday.  before long two buds of og kush disappear and the coffee kicked in. the wisecracking father of daughter joy has returned. he drops pilgram jokes on his own hat. hes even shooting in one of the suit jackets love for the groomer remains at zero. hes compliant and now ready for his interview. over the next 30 minutes schoolboys at his most focused\u2013\u2013hes concise when explaining why hed rather have all the attention on his album than himself brotherly while discussing kendricks grammy snub and most vulnerable when addressing his alleged addiction to lean cough syrup and soda on the rocks. guess that dunkin donuts cup wasnt filled with java after all. yock  bonsu thompson: the energy around oxymoron feels strong and youve personally raved about it. do you seriously feel like it could be one of those special albums  schoolboy q: yeah. it doesnt sound like nothing  the show and im 90 years old and done died in the hotel room.  bt: how have you been dealing with remaining sober beyond just smoking weed  q: i dont deal with pills no more. i smoke weed but i just started back fucking with lean a little bit. im not on it like that like you would think.  bt: why would you go back to lean  q: its just stupid. but my tour starts march 1st. its over once the tour starts. its just something that i fucked with again for a little bit.  bt: are you saying its not really an addiction  q: its not an addiction. its something i wanna do. its not smart though. its not good for my body but im doing it. im not telling people to do it. its just a phase im going through right now. i shouldnt even be talking about it.  bt: and when your tour ends  q: hopefully i dont grab it again. i didnt touch it my whole recording process. that was two years of nothing. once i finished and turned my album in thats when i had hit the dope man and it was like bring me a cup. laughs march 1st its over. i gotta go back to my work. i cant give the fans a good show off the lean.
