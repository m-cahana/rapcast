{"kid cudi": ["", "  i think the braggadocio--the money cash hoes thing--needs to be deaded. i feel like thats holding us back as a culture as black people; it doesnt advance us in any way shape or form. weve been doing that same thing for years now its like like what four decades of the same old . sorry for my language. and i feel like you know if youre gonna be an artist theres a time when you just have to embrace the responsibility and understand that the power of music is something so special and to be able to do in on this magnitude where you reach millions of people its like why not use that for good why not tell kids something that they can connect with in their life.  and really my mission statement since day one - and im getting so worked up talking about this. all i wanted to do was help kids not feel alone and stop kids from comitting suicide. *applause* thank you.  and im never trying to be political and im actually like shaking i cant believe im saying this but- *arsenio interrupts*  arsenio: those two specific things where does that come from  cudi: well ive dealt with suicide for the past 5 years you know like it wasnt a week or day that didnt go by where i was just like you know i want to check out you know i know what that feels like and i know it comes from loneliness. i know it comes from not having self-worth not loving yourself. and these are things that - you know kids dont have music that can coach them and give them that guidance.  i didnt have that. i had to listen to jay-z and take certain things from it and the other shit i just didnt know what he was talking about. *laughter* and like now im 30  and im like oh thats what hov was talking about i get it now  but what about the kids who- you never really had an artist where you connected with them all across the board. and i think that thats my job im just really trying to guide people and help people cause loneliness is a terrible terrible thing man and if you dont know how to conquer it it can eat you alive.  arsenio: how are you right now  cudi: im good im alright.
