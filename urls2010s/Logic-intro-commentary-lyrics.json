{"logic": ["  this song first came along when uh.. when 6ix me and 6ix were in the studio uh at no i.d.s spot and.. uh he just did the sample yknow he had it.. and i loved it and i couldnt identify it at first. i felt like i knew what it was but i could not exactly identify it uh.. and it ended up being this song that um.. no i.d. had sampled for kanye wests bound. and i think its so incredible how you can sample yknow.. you give something to ten different producers or rappers and youll get ten different things and and we got something different with this one and for this.. song i wanted it to be extremely musical and beautiful and.. yknow.. its a very very raw hip-hop album but.. i wanted to kinda mess people up when they first heard it um and yeah. so its just kinda talking about the state of hip-hop and not just hip-hop but music as well and where i see myself and kind of where i fit in to it.. um.. before really beginning to tell my story on the next record  "]}
