{"g-eazy": ["  its all about the come up. you know so much of hip-hop is a story of from nothing to something.  ive never owned a car in my life i dont know when i would drive it. ive never owned a house i dont know what i would do with it. id never be in it. people see celebrity as mansion car white teeth and fancy clothes. you know but what they dont see is severe anxiety and fear of falling cause theres no safety net under me.  there was no plan b there was no trust fund or anything like that. it was like this has to work. like have endless nights back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back killing yourself in the studio. like the misery the pain. does this mean anything is this trash like no one cares. you do not have an audience no one cares about what youre making its all in your head. and i was just like determined like it had to happen.  thats the thing about music is its not like a 9 to 5 when youre done you go home. you have to run with it you have to work your ass off and kill yourself to get any kind of results. i kill myself in the studio because i want to be great. you know and i want to make something that matters to people. you have to project out into the universe what you want out of the world. you know what do you want to be the best at it didnt happen overnight you know so its tough to look back and say like well when did it happen you know. when did your whole life change i dont know gradually over the last 5 years. so its like if i do want to have a house one day if i do ever want to enjoy driving a car one day its not just gonna just fall in my lap or maybe i dont know.
