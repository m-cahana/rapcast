twenty minutes late and my manager blowing me up security guard in the garage at the entrance we roll down the window and show him our credentials terrell flash the pass and he lets us continue metal detectors phone losing reception i should be grateful this my nine to five i walk into the green room alright alright i get on youtube tryna learn how to tie on my tie fuck it ill wear the bolo tonight night night i probably shouldnt have done the drugs ive done a couple of days ago detox son i forgot my belt at the hotel fuck now my team all scrambling to help this sucks i need something to cope aint nothing to cope i eat  a banana and i drink a cup of throat coat i wish i had the homies with me here but nope most of the artists that i know dont get invited to this show because success to them determines our value the make-up the power hairspray perfume makeup and powder the ratings come down to whos popular now in the song in the hour knock at the door i let them in hair and makeup now red carpet in ten she covers up my freckles concealer on my chin i look orange but she swears it looks natural with my skin the show is starting they take me to my seat walk in the arena feel the ego of elites like the whole industry is staring at me a row away from taylor two away from jay and bey  ", " curtain opens up host walks out we stand in unison and applaud real loud i watch the other people that have been around for a while just excited i got invited feeling cool in the crowd thinking such and such is bold look at such and suchs gold damn such and such in real life looks really fuckin old such and such is fine shes with such and such oh im here but im barely even watching the show cause tonight we toast to our accomplishments insecurity dressed up as confidence i said tonight we toast to our accomplishments insecurity dressed up as confidence an award is given out commercial reset the scene they keep saying coming soon is the biebs watch celebrities take selfies with celebrities it feels so make believe they want the gossip they want the drama they want britney spears to make out with madonna they want kanye to rant and to go on longer cause that equates to more dollars they want talking topics they want trending topics they want outfits to be outlandish they want sideways glances beef and problems they want nipple slips cause they live for clicks this is economics so we botox our skin and we smile for the camera might as well get a new nose while were at it this is america insecuritys our fabric and we wear it and we renamed it fashion i look to my right theres a cameraman snapping picture after picture after sister after sister of the line of kardashians mind so distracted realized theres an ovation and everyones clapping  ", "", "   its just weird when the cameras on you gotta remember to still clap if i lose i see myself up on the screen split into five different artists on tv and just look normal dont get turned into a meme relax breathe and the award goes to: macklemore and ryan lewis me theres a stranger holding my award i give her an awkward hug she says its yours think im supposed to kiss her on the cheek man i should have prepared an acceptance speech do i talk first is it ryan is it me fuck it ill take the lead grab the mic say my piece do i look at camera one do i look at camera three i promise im honored id like to thank god my momma and father id like to thank tricia the mother of my daughter i couldnt have done it without you all in my corner especially the fans been here since the beginning supported the music allowed us to be independent and i know i shouldnt be long-winded wait hold up dont play the music let me finish this feels so narcissistic dressed as a celebration to conceal its a business me me me my my image my my songs my self interest one big reality show that is scripted and i can keep trying or get off the competition id rather run out of my fifteen minutes than have life past me by and i forget to live it but that doesnt mean retirement but i dont like who i am in this environment i forgot what this arts for i didnt get through freshman year to drop out as a sophomore here i am in this arena yeah im scared i got the peoples attention dont wanna lose it here thinking about my career miserable here but wanna make sure im invited next year to the same damn party celebrities and aisles same blank stares same fake smiles same big budget production i know now who i am when the lights go out and it falls down and the curtain closes nobody notices wanted to throw up the roc wanted to be hova wanted to be wayne with the accent from the nolia thought id feel better when the award show was over but i guess i showed up late almost got cut off when they closed the gate just in time what will i say time to explain this unruly mess ive made i guess i showed up late almost got cut off when they closed the gate just in time what will i say time to explain this unruly mess
