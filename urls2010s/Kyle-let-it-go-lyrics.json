{"kyle": ["  every night i lie awake my thoughts come rollin in love is won love is lost and loves that might have been  i see the ghost of long lost hope and shattered broken dreams i know its time to carry on its harder than it seemed  ive gotta let it go all the pain is ripe ive gotta let it go and move on with my life  ive gotta let it go its time to let it leave ive gotta let it go and then i can be free  the times gone by i cant deny they left a mark on me dont understand the master plan that only god can see  i need to know i wont let go and lock it all inside i wonder why they say goodbye and gather up my pride  ive gotta let it go all the pain is ripe ive gotta let it go and move on with my life  ive gotta let it go its time to let it leave ive gotta let it go and then i can be free  i know i have the will to carry on lifes made me strong ive learned too much to turn my head away im gonna stand  brick by brick ill build my life again and ill begin to learn from all of my mistakes and make them fly away ive gotta let it go  ive gotta let it go ive gotta let it go ive gotta let it go  ive gotta let it go ive gotta let it go ive gotta let it go  ive gotta let it go all the pain is ripe ive gotta let it go and move on with my life  ive gotta let it go its time to let it leave ive gotta let it go  "]}
