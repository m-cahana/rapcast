{"kid cudi": ["  look at that handsome face  uhh okay. just wanna check the mic first  get the sound right. this is not comedy hour i promise.  the funny thing is: i used to go to this school. and my class used to sit like in this area here. yeah o2 whos an o2er  kendra come here kendra come on kendra  everybody come give me a hug i mean how long has it been two decades come up here i was at all doing me. . how about that \u2013 reunion  okay. so its just a little surreal i havent been in this room since 1999 2000 maybe. so im 31 i just turned 31 on january 30th how about that oh thank you thank you.  and when i was approached to do this ted talk i was immediately like: why and then it was kinda like put in perspective by me in \u2013 im not really one to do speeches im really weird if you can imagine as i do the performing and im on stage doing this is my job. its different to stand up in front of people like this when theres this light and speak and you know express yourself in this way.  but i told myself okay how am i gonna be able to do this let me just talk about my life. thats something i know better than anyone else. and i feel like coming from cleveland coming from shaker you know such a diverse place and just looking in the audience from the people i cant see its still \u2026 very diverse. but i believe that my upbringing in this town the school district is what made me the man i am today.  and when i moved away when i was 20 years old my mom was extremely sad \u2013 wheres my mom at yeah. she was crying. hey mommy. my first big fan was my mom. and it was really interesting i remember leaving home and shes giving me a hug at the airport and she leans and she goes: you can always come back around you can go right back home you can change your mind everything will be fine. im like: no im going this is happening. and you know walk into security and then looking back and just seeing her like: ohhh... and me just being like: errr\u2026  however as soon as i turned back around i knew i was on a mission on this very specific quest. you know it was bigger than just wanting to be a musician or do movies. it was about: finally showing the world what scott could do. i wasnt the best student imma be honest with you kendra knows this. if kendra was in my class and she was sitting next to me i probably would have tried to cheat off her.  but thats not the point. the point is its like: when i think about it you know i wish i applied myself as much as i applied all the energy into music as i did as in music as you know as in music i wish i could have applied that same energy into my academics when i was in school. so a lot of people look at me now and they go: oh man this must be dope to be a rapper. and it is dope its awesome.   but you know i cant say that i dont wanna sometimes go back and relearn some things. i cant say i dont feel out of certain conversations that my friends have. you know and these are things that i think about you know cause being at school is all about being cool and wearing the fresh \u2013 i was gonna curse but \u2013 wearing fresh clothing. and being popular. and when you go out into the real world you realize that that moment is just a little beep of your life. high school you know. now i remember kendra  but everything else i dont remember. no im just joking. but im just saying: at that moment in life you feel like thats all that matters. high school its like: oh this girl doesnt like me this guy here and theres all this drama this drama and you go into the real world and you know its about just trying to make your mark in the world. and i never got the chance to do that academically.  so i had this fire i had this fire to pursue this musical career. i had no idea how to go about it. i was living with my uncle who was up in the age at the time. 80 years old. older uncle. so when i moved to new york its not he could show me around show me all the cool spots you know he was just kinda like: theres the train and you get a metro card and you go. and i was: yeah okay we got the rapid i can do this. its all right. i was immediately wrong for that for assuming that it was gonna be the same. it is not the same.  um but i embraced it. i embraced the fear the danger. i enjoyed the fact that i was going in uncharted territory. it was like a sense of wonder for me. and i cant say i was one of those people that was into like having thrills and you know getting some type of stimulation from that but it was nothing like saying like: yall im gonna out and pursue something and i know im gonna do it. and nobodys gonna tell me i cant. and everybody that doesnt believe it imma prove it to em sooner or later. and thats just what it is. because i wont point i didnt feel like i was smart enough to pass that test. or i didnt feel like i was smart enough to go to this college.  but with music it was like: nobodys gonna take that from me. you know what im saying because it was things that i was dealing with as a youth at this school that i didnt talk to people about. that probably kept me from put my best foot forward with my academics. you know and with music it was a platform for me to express myself and also realize that im not that crazy. that theres other kids out there that might me depressed or lonely dealing with suicide things like this.  and it was one of those things that you know i just feel really blessed to just have my mom who has been my supporter forever who supplied that trip financially first couple of months or whatever. um to have the support of my home town i can come back in this room and just feel the love and energy you guys got me really nervous my palms are sweaty. but um its really just the clock its like: 11 minutes 24 seconds 23 seconds 22 seconds \u2026 its like whats gonna happen when that clocks over with its like somebody gon just pull me off stage geez.  um. but um really i first thing i did when i went to new york and most people think it was kinda like this amazing adventure \u2013 it wasnt. it was pretty much finding a job. and for the first couple years i was working everywhere. you know whether it was like at this clothing store here or abercrombie & fitch or american apparel or dean & deluca i always had a job. i was a hustler. and you know i still apply that same work ethic with the music.  you know what i mean like im almost in a way dont know how to relax because my whole life has been just a grind. you know what i mean and i think that when people ask me: man how do you do it you know im just kinda like: i dont know like i was just \u2026 focused you know because its hard to put it into words because i cant say that its just something i flipped a switch i just flipped when i turned 20. like i was always this guy.  you know i was always outspoken and creative and artsy i used to draw when i was a kid it was before all the musical stuff came along. i was an artist. you know i used to draw all my stuff i used to draw all my tattoos and i said: oh when i get 18 imma draw imma get these tatted. it was about being a cartoonist up until i was like 15. and then i just wanted to be a rapper. and then it was all uphill from that.  but you know \u2026 if i could really just give people one piece of advice you know and it just passes along and one thing i want you to take from this is that like we are all the commanders of our own destiny.  you know what i mean  its like you see these movies where they say like that one movie with \u2026 lucy where she has 100 percent of her brain power and she can do anything she wants. you know and you realize that the average human doesnt use at \u2026 two three percent. you know what i mean some weird small percentage like that.  i really just told myself from jump like: hey man im gonna do this and i apply the information that i needed to execute that and in places times of my life where i didnt have the answers i make sure to get the information or surround myself with people that had the information. you know what i mean you cant hang out with people that aint doing nothing. how you gon get money hanging around with people that aint got no money you know what im saying  like how you gon be inspired by people who arent at least trying to go the same way at least whether its music or schooling like i would be inspired by all my friends cause i went to college i went to university toledo for one year for film \u2013 it sucked i hated it. you know it wasnt for me. but my film class my film classes were amazing um and now that im doing acting producing shows writing shows i wish i wrote that whole couple three more years out cause i would have information that i needed and i wouldnt have to go through so many hoops to be able to direct or create my own film or tv show. um i dont know why i said that let me get back on track \u2026 okay.  so um really you know people like i say come up to me all the time and they like: man but you did it man youre special youre different \u2013 and im not. any different. from you you \u2013 were all the same. i came from this town. i went to this school. all my buddies we all had the same opportunities you know its kinda just like: having that self-confidence. you know and it was a lot of areas in my personality where i wasnt as confident. you know definitely with the chicks. early on. i dont know if kendra knows this.  but the music me doing something where i was like: wow i made this like my first album when that came out i was like: wow i made this this is something that i put all my energy into and its out and its released to the world on a professional level. i was so proud of myself. but: lets do it again. i didnt have time to be like: yeah my first album yeah yeah people like it it was like: okay we did good it didnt suck what are we gonna do again we gotta do another one. and then i did that one: okay people like it lets do a third one. you cant get caught up in just all the other things you know i really was like even still to this day i have my front but its focused you know its never you know even when i do straight im still working. im still writing a song im still doing something. im persistent.  you know um and thats also another part you know i believe that some people get lazy. some people might have that one painting that they started to paint and never finish it. because they get caught up in their head and its: oh i cant do this maybe i cant do this. its like sticking to something. one goal at a time. you know that was like thats still big for me. i never put too much on my plate. you know at first it was like the music and then the acting kinda came into play early on and i it was unexpected but it was a blessing that i was prepared for. i was like: man. ive been a class clown since forever lets do this. and i used to do it for free now im getting paid for this is great. um so you know im glad you guys like my jokes im not even a comedian this is just\u2026  um so you know just kinda fast forward cause its so much im tryna squeeze into 5 minutes 56 seconds. um but you know man there are a lot of haters there are a lot of doubters there are a lot of people that would telling me: man you aint gon do that. thats not gon happen. hell be back. i would tell all my buddies: im moving to new york \u2013 all right youll be back nah. nah. im not coming back. and if i do come back its for a concert. you know and everybody be like: alright whatever.  and when i came back it was for a concert. it was for a concert and it was the most beautiful homecoming ive ever had. its no show more important than this show. and im not just saying that because it was like: in cleveland and its like my home town. it was the first time i saw my peers friends i went to school with being proud of me. i didnt get the moment to walk across stage with everybody. i didnt get the cap and gown. you know what i mean i didnt get the chance to see these guys because i moved to solon 11th grade. its like even seeing kendra is wild because i havent seen anybody in so long. um but thats the beautiful moment still to this day i do shows and i see a class mate in the crowd and i forget my raps im gonna: oh \u2026 oh \u2026 happy you got any kids im sorry i gotta \u2026 you know its wild. you know  and i didnt get that at school. i didnt play on the football team \u2013 i tried but i was terrible. i didnt play on the basketball team \u2013 i tried but i was terrible. i didnt wrestle. i tried \u2013 no no. i did try. but i tried outside of the shaker heights high school in another district in cleveland heights where none of my peers could see me and me be embarrassed. it was kinda just like: okay i try this in 7th grade and be terrible and then nobody in shaker will know about it \u2013 cause its in cleveland heights theyre just talking over there.  but my point is also like music was my plan g. you know it wasnt like i didnt try anything else like i tried everything else. i tried everything i thought you know was a traditional thing a young boy should do \u2013 sports you know and even going to college was me just tryna fulfill a destiny where i thought it was my own destiny but also i wanted to make my mom happy. you know and sometimes guys we gotta do that. you know theres a lot of things that we dont wanna do stuff but its like man like your parents  they really have to deal with a lot of our shit. and you know its like and now im at 31 and im just like: i have to apologize to my mom was it like seven years ago i was like: mom i am sorry. like: i was a nightmare. but we got money now so lets just go like\u2026 and were okay. were good now.  um and its funny too cause i took my mom to get her first tattoo ever i forced her to get a tattoo and its so funny cause she \u2013 are you are you embarrassed im sorry. but this is big you know because our relationship from the kid i was at high school its the best its ever been. you know i used to put my mom through hell. but she was my supporter. and thats what parents are there to do. to give you the devils advocate even when im not gon say every time i told my mom i was moving to new york she was like: pff. okay. aight. you know but that was more so like the fear of letting your child go out into the world more so like the people in the street that are just hating on you dont wanna see you win.  parents care. now i got a four-and-a-half-year-old shell be five in march. shes the apple of my eye. shes my little baby. and shes so funny you know cause im the one who gets emotional when she has to leave you know and im kinda just like when shes leaving im like: you know imma miss you right and then shes like: yeah. and im like: you gon miss daddy \u2013 yeah. oh my \u2026 you know you can call me and stuff when you miss me and im just sad youre leaving. shes like: its okay. we always come back. and i was just like: thats what im saying all that thats why im crying im so emotional but it was just like beautiful to just see you know like me be the parent now. you know what im saying and to see that confidence of my child and the same confidence i gave my mom and you gotta just kinda take it backseat and go: okay. cause i literally like follow my daughters lead. i mean i just whatever she is telling me to do i just follow whatever she \u2013 well i mean obviously not in every way. or else like i would be broke but \u2026 in some ways i do what she asks me to do or what she tells me to do.  but thats the beauty of life yall. you know what im saying i used to come in this room i used to sit right in that section. sometimes id pay attention \u2013 sometimes i wouldnt. most of the time id be checking out chicks. some chick i probably never talk to cause i never had the confidence maybe if a \u2013 whats the day that we would send carnations kendra valentines day. that wasnt a joke. i was the king of like sending like carnations to chicks that i never talk to. i would be asking my mom for like: mom can you give me five bucks you know its  today i wanna . and she would just be like: okay you know not knowing that i was buying carnations for all these chicks you know but thanks for supplying that mom.  but with 23 seconds left. i just what yall know that life will throw you through shit ton of curve balls its scary but like if you believe man. you know i you believe. and if you want it. and if you wanna work hard enough for it. you can be so. cause its no difference from me and you. i just really wanted this shit. i wanted it bad. you know and i didnt want to be a failure. and nobodys a failure in this room. dont ever think that. we can all win. and thats it.  thanks.
