{"travis scott": [" and i figured out\u2026damn thats what that is i gotta make beats.   my vision was being ahead of whats going on\u2014like two three years ahead. scotts childhood home in houston where his mother worked at at&t as an apple liason and his dad ran his own advertising business soon became a revolving door for friends and randoms from school who wanted to record. i was always in a group he says speaking of his early projects. i feel like my shit was tainted because either somebodys voice wasnt right or i was sounding corny as fuck he says. i was in a group with another rapper. this nigga was like my best friend. i had a vision and he had a reality. those are two different things. my vision was being ahead of whats going on\u2014like two three years ahead. he was living in the reality hanging out with niggas he would think was his friend. it was the downfall of everything. you gotta learn how to completely not fuck with people. thats a hard thing to do. just keep walking. trusting your own vision. some of those projects including travisxjason a duo he was part of with a rapper named o.g. chess until they had a falling out in 2011 can still be found with some creative googling. their full-length cruisn usa is promising largely inoffensive and miles away from the darker terrain scott would soon inhabit with owl pharaoh his biggest artistic statement to date.  that mixtape released last spring is a joyfully dark collection of maximalist wheezing tracks that lumber under their own weight gears grinding to push out laconic future music hatched from houstons long lineage of screwed-down songs that evoke codeine and candy paint and drowsy psychedelia but imbued with texas lonely flatland and scotts husky often deadpan voice. scotts been on a robert rodriguez kick lately. at one point mid-sentence he pauses to look at the tv where a trailer for the directors machete kills comes on. scott points at the screen. thats why i gotta work with this guy he says as the actor danny trejo stone-faced stalks across a burnt yellow desert landscape in slow motion. scotts sound is ambitious but it isnt exactly experimental. instead hes working in the anything-goes mold already supplied by numerous artists before him: wests towering artistic statements t.i.s elastic voice the neptunes digital experimentation. like any kid that grew up in the internet era scott has absorbed everything around him blended it together and come out with a style that is a product of all music everywhere existing on the same plane. nothing is off-limits when you have access to everything. and with that access scott is dead-set on mastering every art form he takes on. i was always about doing both he says of rapping and producing. i wanted to learn. i wanted to know how to do it. that was my biggest thing about everything. i wanted to know how to use everything. thats why i do videos. i know how to work a camera edit a video. i just want to know. i dont like someone knowing more than me. his music is an appropriately cinematic reflection of his open mind and keen ear blending iconic phrases from other peoples radio hits with a production style that evokes every regional rap trope from new yorks claustrophobically heavy drums to las slow-rolling funk without sounding like much of an imitation of any of them.  the first time you hear his voice on uptown a highlight from owl pharaoh he sounds pretty much like how youd imagine the devil to sound. over grating hyper-compressed strings his multi-layered voice grunts im riding up uptown/ whoo im a motherfucking monster/ whoo one hand on the wheel one hand on my dick. then his words start speeding up finally colliding into each other in a manic fit: at the green light im speeding/ fourth wheel on im weaving/ i got red eyes...swag seizures. the motherfucking monster line is a callback to wests monster but here scott sounds like hes living up to the impossible claim. he sounds inhuman. even in his day-to-day life scott has the energy of a hyperactive teenager. he works constantly\u2014often in hotel rooms or random studios scattered all over the world\u2014but hes rarely alone and if hes not making music hes always in motion. he climbs on things wrestles his friends knocks over lukewarm water into a pile of swisher shards tosses his shoes into corners and then kicks them into other corners. he wanders new york with the familiarity and complicated emotions of a former resident. at one point he scores a pair of green bape sandals that are basically modified birkenstocks and he wears them everywhere the very next day. later at the boutique clothing store surface to air he tries on a sweatshirt but his friends deem it too small so he sits down on a bench hits his g-pen and puts one of them in a headlock.   - travi$ is not here to make number one rap songs. those people get high off of making number one songs. im into making number one fucking albums. - its this surplus of nervous energy that makes scott such a compelling  performer. live he makes every stage seem like its actually a trampoline. he is never not jumping flailing pacing climbing rafters screaming his voice raw. theres a video of a performance at new yorks club s.o.b.s last summer where just over three minutes into his set he already has his shirt off the room is pitch black the crowd is chanting along with him and it looks more like a hardcore show than a typically discerning not-impressed-by-anything dead-eyed new york rap crowd. in interviews though scott is all over the place half-finishing thoughts going on hilarious tangents that take him miles from his original point. but his enthusiasm skews these moments as charming not embarrassing. when he talks about his long-delayed first meeting with west at the jungle city recording studios in manhattan in 2012 while working on cruel summer his story is a mess of clipped sentences that dead-end even as they get more enthusiastic: ", " kilhoffer my manager has known ye for x amount\u2026i didnt even see ye for like four weeks. i was like what the fuck this is kind of weird. i was in some studio around the corner. i added shit in on theraflu and that was it and that was when i met lifted for the first time\u2014that was the dude that did the mercy beat. i got hit up like yo we want you to fuck with this mercy track. i fucked with it and turned it in. it came out and i was like oh shit thats the first time i heard some of my sounds. so time goes on and i didnt meet ye yet and i was like man thats weird. so i get back to jungle city and theyre like yeah he wants to meet you around five. and i didnt see this nigga for three days. i did the dont like remix\u2014the drums and shit. ", "", "   travi$ scott: no fear beware of travi$ scott raps new radical  for about the millionth time a car rockets off a cliff and lands in the water below but no one really says anything about it. travi$ scott a lanky 21-year-old rapper and producer from houston is renting a room at new yorks hudson hotel with a bunch of childhood friends many of whom now live in the city but currently seem to be enjoying a stay-cation sitting on the couch smoking an endless stream of blunts in between cautious swigs from a bottle of jameson. the crew is laconically borderline disinterestedly playing grand theft auto v. scott beat the game a few times already but theres something wrong with it and it wont save so theyre just messing around playing through the early parts exploring the games eerie topographical accuracy before launching cars off precipices and into buildings at random then tossing the controller to the next person on the small couch.  the light is dim but warm and scott is in the other corner of the room hunched in an office chair staring into the glow of a laptop and twiddling his stubby braids which caterpillar off his head and stop short of his temples. its a chaotic space but hes so zoned out that he barely notices his friends endless run of suicide missions.  instead hes trying to find the right drum sound for his remix of king krules dubby neptune estate. the pairing initially seems a bit weird. king krule is the recording alias of archy marshall a 19-year-old british singer/songwriter with an old soul and a voice that sounds like its been dragged through cigarette ashes and a couple sludgy pints of beer. scott for his part makes music that plays out like the soundtrack to a bunch of transformers fighting each other in a post-apocalyptic desert landscape with towering synths jockeying for position against drums that sound big enough to eat the whole world. still both artists thrive in a musical environment that allows them to seem like the only people left on earth; its like theyre linked by a bombastic caricature of loneliness scott with his wide-open expanses and marshall with his drizzly london streets.  right now scotts zeroed in on a drum loop that sounds like its submerged in cotton and a couple snatches of a verse which hes mumbling into the microphone barely saying words grasping at a cadence and flow thatll match the vibe of king krules original. as scott gets more confident his voice gets louder his words clarify and his subtle houston drawl gets more pronounced. his friends who havent really been paying attention to what hes doing get quiet or at least quieter. when scott gets stumped about which words come next he asks did i write this on somebody elses phone phones are passed around and eventually he finds it. the writing is actually a voice recording from sometime earlier. he listens to the blown-out fragment a couple times then hunches over the mic like hes focusing on a school test: stumbled out my hotel late\u2026voice receding to a mumble again\u2026knocking on my mamas door she couldnt tell i wasnt sober. hes speaking even lower now but its clear that hes found what he was looking for. he stops proudly letting out a whooooo. all of this seems to happen in a matter of minutes which suggests that scott is both sure of himself and the kind of artist who is always turning ideas over in his head thinking about the music hes going to make even when hes not making it. recently scotts been on a roll. in 2012 he spent time in hawaii and new york working on the kanye west-helmed g.o.o.d. music posse album cruel summer; 2013 brought him to paris once again working with west on the now-notorious whirlwind yeezus sessions. his conversations are peppered with anecdotes about meetings with major record executives and hes brimming with stories about hanging out with west. hes excitedly told multiple interviewers one that involves west getting a taco bell doritos loco taco delivered to his studio on a hermes plate.  before that scott spent a large part of his early adult life shunting around the country in search of his own career taking label meetings that went nowhere and were often canceled or pushed back even as he was flying to them. today he seems poised on the brink of success securing with the help of his manager anthony kilhoffer a producer and engineer who has known west since 2002 and worked closely with him since 2004s college dropout a spot at three tables in the hip-hop powerhouse\u2014a deal with epic plus affiliations with wests g.o.o.d. music crew and t.i.s warner imprint grand hustle. but it took a move from houston to new york then houston again then new york again and now for the time being los angeles to get there. i just like the vibe he says of la like hes thinking about it for the first time. hell later recite the whole list of back-and-forth moves wearily virtually counting off locations on his fingers as though each held thousands of miniature success stories and close calls with personal failure. listening to scott talk about his early days as an artist its clear that his talent was there but his direction was not. in high school he rapped over other rappers instrumentals but that didnt feel quite right so he started making his own beats. i used to call myself a producer but i was an engineer he says. i used to record my friends and i thought that was being a producer. then i saw that ye video where he had the yellow polo  chop lost the files for the track so man\u2026then i met him. i played him what owl pharaoh was at the time and he was like whoa and i was like i got these ideas and i was singing on it and we just kept talking\u2026  scott is clearly working in the shadow of west not only in the tone and cadence of his rapping but also in his disinterest in participating in a traditional path to fame. success for scott doesnt mean being the most visible or making the most hits. it means having a clear vision of what he wants to do. i feel like im the opposite of the system\u2014im the opposite of what mike will is he says. you will not be able to compare me to a mike will or to a young chop or any of these niggas that make number one rap songs. travi$ is not here to make number one rap songs. those people get high off of making number one songs. im into making number one fucking albums. extended long projects that are consistent. that system is the a&r calls you like oh i need a beat for this niggas album for so-and-sos album like a mariah carey.  scotts belief in the emotional power of the album format isnt just willful ignorance of the music industry hes part of though. he saw a disconnect between what labels wanted and what he was looking for and decided to follow his own instincts so that he wouldnt be manipulated by an out-of-touch industry. niggas was going mad platinum because they couldnt download music for free he says. thats what labels gotta realize. it wasnt just because you was the best motherfucker alive because yall the best label. its just because niggas couldnt access the internet fast enough. now niggas is smarter than you. its like the fat white man sitting in the chair like ah yes we got these motherfuckers they cant get this shit for free. this is the only way you can buy it. you cannot be commercial no more. you must be real. apparently realness is synonymous with fearlessness for scott because during the numerous photo shoots he participates in for this story he inexplicably finds himself in insanely high places. at one point hes crouched precariously on the corner of the roof of a photography studio in the flatiron district a coat hanging from his body like a high-fashion version of batmans cape. his face is partially obscured by the fabric phantom of the opera-style but his grill\u2014which he is currently stretching his mouth wide to show off\u2014is glinting in the remnants of the evening sun.  not 24 hours later hes on the top floor of a very tall construction site. the building is still unfinished so everyone is wearing hard hats and ugly neon vests. the floor is littered with construction equipment and massive metal girders. scotts surrounded by exposed concrete foundation thatll eventually be covered up. right now though people are taking pleasure in writing their names and the date all over the wall anxious to be an invisible part of the citys history. scott wants to do this too so sharpie in hand he scoots himself up some wiggly plywood thats angled against the wall and writes his name in blocky letters on the grey surface shading in parts of the t after hes done writing it all out as big as he possibly can. the marker is thin so its not really visible unless you get up close but he works meticulously anyway. a couple times scott slips back down the plywood but he wedges his feet grips the pen and gets back to work. pretty soon all this will be covered. probably no one except some construction workers will see his name here but hes leaving his mark anyway exactly how he wants it.
