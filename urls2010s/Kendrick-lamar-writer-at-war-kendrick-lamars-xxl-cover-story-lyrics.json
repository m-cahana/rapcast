{"kendrick lamar": ["when i try to soak it all in thats the only thing that kindve scare me feel me life is sad in general and im meeting these different people every day. it kindve snaps me back into reality outside of what i do. outside of the girls outside of the cars the money it really aint that important when you meeting somebody thats still in the struggle. these the people that live their lives in dark spaces every day  you know and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going almost like a bible you know these kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say kendrick i believe in you. i believe in your music. and what happens it puts me in some type of space where its almost like some type of worship or responsibility but i know it. i can see it anything i say or do i dont take back i dont regret.i think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous i am. or even excluding the word i hate the word famous. im aware of it. i know people treat me different because of it. and the more i am aware of that and play into it the more i become detached from the real world. so its really about balance. the more somebody opens the door for me and i walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me the more i become separate from others  i had a talk with lauryn hill and she said try to completely throw away your ego. how many times can you throw away an ego you know its tough. its something we all battle with. i battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places\u2014the big spots all the events the lights\u2014its all for your ego. its all for your own confirmation to be like okay im somebody. but truthfully youve always been somebody. you dont need the lights     i try to think about that. also i like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where i came from. i think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now they only think of whats ahead of them which is cool. but i look at pictures of the small little apartment that i come from in compton and things like that. and it always trips me out when i get too far out there where im missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me my moms is and i cant get back to her. sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things  its definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as i make it. of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. and then at the same time your privacy is not respected. and all entertainers go through it but moreso the ones that make very personal music because its not just me youre focusing on now when im out in public but also on individual characters that im talking about in my music. so thats a whole other ballgame and its just something that ive gotta accept when im completely drained of inspiration thats when im finished with the project.i think the way it is the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect its more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my moms van that was on my album cover that she actually still has. id never think that would happen but its happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. she cant drive that thing no more. and shes old school she wanna drive it. but i never want them to be in this type of world because not everybody can handle it. i think the average person wouldnt be able to handle the day-to-day. its a lot of things you gotta deal with. so me doing that its just a piece of me. i gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it  id be lying to you to say i knew good kid m.a.a.d city would be as successful as it has been. in the beginning i was very doubtful. once i was done the jitters hit me so fast. i was so confident in making it because i was like this is it man. nobody heard this story and if you heard it you heard it in bits and pieces but im finna put it to you in a whole album\u2014from compton from the hood from the streets\u2014its a whole other perspective and light ima go back and do the skits just like how biggie and dre and snoop and pac did it. and ima tell my story. then i wrapped up with it and said man whats on the radio right now i dont think they doin skits and things like that. i dont know if the people are gonna understand what im talkin about on this album because its almost like a puzzle pieced together and albums aint been created like this in a long time. albums that actually still reach the masses at least     my whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. this is what you think as a kid. you dont know nothing about creative process and things like that. so i didnt know how blessed i was to actually go and make an album that i can create and control 100 percent. when i was done with it i was like man these people believe in me like this they let me just do this whole thing by myself like this i dont know. yall sure im right  i was nervous because i didnt think the people would understand it. and i get a call from pharrell. he said he had a copy of the album and its amazing. and i was like that call was right on time because that was when i was feeling super insecure about it. pharrell said never feel that way again. when that little negative man come behind your head always follow your first heart and that was your first heart to put the album out like this. this is his words verbatim he said watch whats gonna happen. i believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money it makes you be you times ten.when i come up to certain artists artists that ive always looked up to and they can recite my records that wasnt the single that puts me in a space where okay this is a person i always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. i always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money and things i could do for my family  because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods you was taught that having money was success and thats all you see all you know. so once i got the money and everything else that comes with it i felt like i wasnt satisfied. im looking around like this is great security but i dont even spend it on myself i spend it on my loved ones. that makes me feel good knowing i can support somebody thats in need. but at the same time im feeling like okay whats after this so what i realized was my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that i looked up to for so many years and knowing that i put in that same dedication and work and them saying thank you. and them being able to recite them lyrics kendrick lamar - bitch dont kill my vibe ", "i think the first time i played bitch dont kill my vibe for andre 3000 was before it came out. i never share my album while im creating. i think that the situation with andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with dre and dre was like play some stuff . i cant say no to dr. dre. but me creating music i never really play music for anybody even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. so along with that i cut off everything on the radio; i really just duck off from music. because im gonna be influenced and i dont want to be. that has always been my process. i just feel like its really the only prized possession that i actually can control you know its selfishness for sure but its my selfishness and i own it  i know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. but with me personally i can only speak for myself this is me. anything i say or do i dont take back i dont regret. thats how i was feeling at the time and thats how yall gonna get it and i own it. love me or hate me i own it. it is what it is. and thats how i look at it  from 13 years old to the time i was 21 i was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. like a rappers rapper using my tongue as a sword a fuckin barbarian. thats all it was about slaying words. so when i turned 21 22 somewhere around there i got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper cause this is around the same time where cats werent putting out mixtapes anymore. they was putting out full bodies of work and wasnt even signed to a major label. so by that time thats when i started developing and actually constructing my music from a writers point of view. good kid m.a.a.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. and thats how i treat everything. everything is critical like that from here on out. its the art of writing so you ask yourself in the midnight hour who am i is this really what im supposed to be doing how did i get here why am i doing this whats my responsibilitythis is more than just music for me. this is actually a piece of me. im obsessed with it. and thats how i take it. when i make my music it comes from a genuine space where im already spreading myself wide to the world. so during my process in creating it that time is for me personally. thats for my heart those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. that was my memories. taking those inspirations and going into that booth thats something that i hold dear  when im completely drained of inspiration thats when im finished with the project. when i start maybe trying to tamper with things that i shouldnt tamper with ive already had done thats when im done and i know ive exhausted inspiration. that comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. i always want to put it down to the last idea and once im drawn away from it thats when i say okay lets take all these pieces\u2014they might not even be songs\u2014lets take these pieces and construct it. so what i want to say and how i want to execute it becomes clear     its the best part because the things that i say on my records\u2014this is another reason why i dont just play records for people\u2014you wont necessarily get it until its constructed. i know what type of artist i am. im not an artist thats gonna give you a single and say this is what my albums gonna sound like go sell it. thats not me. im just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. everybody has their own niche. with mine i just own it and i know thats exactly what that is. and i wanna keep that lane. i dont want to jump in somebody elses lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. so i stay where i feel like im inspired  whats crazy to me is that i feel the same energy now that i felt before my first album. i know theres lot of pressure for me on this new album but it dont necessarily scare me. its almost confirmation like go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. because i remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: dr. dre had snoop dogg 50 cent eminem you seen what eminem did right yeah uh huh. kendrick lamar he from the west coast and compton too. dre from compton you see the legacy he left. yeah so i hope that album is good. matter fact you got the weight on your shoulders right now.  thank you for that. let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back ", "", "   writer at warkendrick lamar in his own words.a lot of times in interviews people ask me things like how does it feel now what have you bought your mom and your pops and family nobody ever really asks about what its like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. how much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. i cant make a song like i without being in that dark place. i comes from going overseas going to new york being in l.a. and hearing kids saying kendrick i was gonna kill myself last week. section.80 good kid m.a.a.d city saved my life. or i was gonna kill myself tonight until i came to your show.  i believe that they are telling the truth. at first i wasnt so sure maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. but then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. or i look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs its a whole different story to me. thats when i learned that while im making music for myself drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself this teenager listens to every word i say. and thats spooky  i think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. you always grow up and you hate the term role model. you would say i dont wanna be a role model. i dont want none of that. but in actuality you are the biggest role model. its impossible to fight the title of role model. especially when the type of music i make is so personal. people feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. they feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. so when i go out and meet them in public i dont get a response like kendrick will you sign this real quick or i wanna just take this picture with you. no they want to have full conversations. i find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something i thought i was going to win best rap album at the grammys. i put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. it didnt have big no. 1 records on it and there wasnt really any commercial hits. it was great songs and i think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. so for me when youre saying rap that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. yep  i found out a lot about myself in these past two years. its scary. i know more about myself now than any other point of my life. i believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money it makes you be you times ten. i was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. and now 15 years later im in front of people every day tens of thousands of people. so that makes me more of a recluse. that makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of l.a. and bounce around different places and things like that what i do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive but the energy around some of these spaces it can draw you into a crazy place.so you ask yourself in the midnight hour who am i is this really what im supposed to be doing how did i get here why am i doing this whats my responsibility its a real trippy thing you feel me and i think its something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. things change for you with success when you get money. i noticed when people started treating me a little bit different the people that i cared about the most my close friends and family. the artist dont necessarily change its usually the people around them. their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. you can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you dont care about them or you dont fuck with them no more when thats not the case. youre just more focused on what you have to do because its bigger  the moment i start seeing change in people around me thats when i know something is a little bit different. then theres tension in the air that i probably cant necessarily deal with at the moment. cause when the industry dont understand me and the business dont understand me these are the people i can run to. what happens when i cant run to them  artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. im always paranoid. im already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes i may overthink things or think too much. so when youre put into a space where you feel like you cant necessarily trust your close ones that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. seriously. all you got is you and god at the end of the day  the hard time for me was probably when i was on the road. its almost like you go on the road and youre gone for two years. and this place youve known your whole life these people youve known your whole life everything is different when you come back. and you feel like damn your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. that dirty stinky smelly tour bus. and thats one thing among numerous other things that have been hard sometimes. to the point where people are pulling for you left and right where you feel like you dont have control over your own life. over your own well-being  what i do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive but the energy around some of these spaces it can draw you into a crazy place. and ive seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. and im saying this right now to let everyone know its real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity  "]}
