{"russ": ["  nicky my child he stands there with the wind in his hair wondering whether the water the wind of the where i fear that someday he might ask me if mine is the blame and ive got no reply save to tell him its all just a game and heather and i lay together and i was in love she weighted up the gains and the losses and gave me the shove the fear of mankinds untogetherness pounds in my heart the deceit of my friends the betrayals of which i am part  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see my two feet standing here questioning  and im just a social experiment tailored to size ive tried out the national machine and the welfare surprise im the rich man the poor man the peace man the war man the beast the festive consumer who ends up consumed in the feast and my fife eyed promoter is clutching two birds in the bush hes a thief hes as bad as the joker theyre both in the rush hes telling me ghandi was handy and jesus sold his ring dunno who to god maybe and everyone knows dat dis doughs gonna make me de king  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see my two feet standing here questioning  meanwhile the ticket collectors are punching their holes into your memories your journeys and into your souls your life sentence starts and the judge hands you down a spare wig saying: get out of that and goodbye old boy have a good gig and the town label makers stare down with their gallery eyes and point with computer stained fingers each time you arise to the rules and the codes and the system that keeps them in chains which is where they belong with no poems no love and no brains  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see my two feet standing there questioning  meanwhile the tv commercials are sweeping the day brainwashing innocent kids into thinking their way the wet politicians and clergymen have much to say defending desires of the sheep they are leading astray and mas favourite pop star is forcing a grin hes a smash obliging the soft-headed viewers to act just as flash the village tv hooks its victims on give away cash the addicts are numbers who serve to perpetuate trash  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see my stupid poetry shuffleing  and the bankers and tycoons and hoarders of money and art full up with baubles and bibles and full of no heart who travel first class on a pleasure excursion to fame are the eyes that are guiding societys ludicrous aim and the village is making its sunday collection in church the church wobbles twixt hell and heavens crumbling perch unnoticed the money box loudly endorses the shame as the world that christ fought is supported by using his name  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see my stupid poetry burbling  and the pin-striped sardine-cum-magician is packed in his train censoring all of the censorship filling his brain he glares through his armour-plate vision and says hmm insane the prisoner is taking his shoes off to walk in the rain and the luminous green prima donna is sniffing the sky she darent tread the earth that shes smelling her birth was too high her bank balance castle is built on opinion and fear which is all she allows within three hundred miles of her ear  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see my stupid poetry burbling  and ive seen all your pedestal values your good and your bad if you really believe them your passing is going to be hard and ive thought through our thought and i know that its blind silly season occurs when our reasoning is trying to fathom a reason and if you really know its all a joke but youre just putting me on well its sure a good act that youve got cos you never let on but if all of that supersale overkill world is for real well theres nowhere to go kid so you might as well start to freewheel  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see my two feet standing there burbling  and i had this dream in here same time as standing awake these various visions rushed through as i giggled and quaked the distant guns thunder my end and i duck for a while auntie lily is handing me candy she chuckles i smile and our village is where i was born and its where i will die and ill never be able to leave it whatever i try the ebb and the flow of the forces of life pass me by which is all that ill know from my birth to my last gasping sigh  and o how the sea she roars with laughter and howls with the dancing wind to see the dying lying there obeying  my age and my time the blood fire wine and rhyme that fills my dream reminds me of an atom in a bubble on a wave that held its breath for one sweet second then was popped and disappeared into fruitful futilities meaningless meaning meaningless meaning  under the toadstool lover down by the dream everything flowing over rainbows downstream silver the turning water flying away ill come to see you sooner im on my way and theres a mirror that im looking straight through and i get it and theres a doorway that im ducking into to forget it but flashing just beyond the sky the shattering midnight gathers and reminding me behind my mind the earth quakes the sun flakes flutter  over the mountain fairground candy flies stay under the moonshine fountain im on my way lemon tree blossom ladies poured my tea after the blue sky breezes following me theres a river that im making it with and i know it and im floating to i dont care where i just go it but flashing just beyond the sky the shattering midnight gathers and reminding me behind my mind the earth quakes the sun flakes flutter  daffodil april petal hiding the game forests of restless chessmen life is the same tides in the sand sun lover watching us dream covered in stars and clover rainbows downstream and the question in the great big underneath is forever and the fanfare that im forcing through my teeth answers never but flashing just beyond the sky the shattering midnight gathers and reminding me behind my mind the earth quakes the sun flakes flutter  the pumpkin coach oh yes and the rags approach and the wind is devouring the ashes  "]}
