{"nipsey hussle": [" so i reached out to you for an interview once crenshaw dropped and you denied us. then you went on a twitter rant about complex and said we had to put up $10000 for an interview. what was the source of your frustration  ", " first off i never took anything personal. i never really took a personal offense to 25\u2026i forgot the title you used. it was kind of a degrading article.  complex was a big supporter from day one of my sh*t. but i started to see a change in the stance it was taking. it was almost like sarcastic\u2026it made me think do you guys even like hip-hop  ", " the 10 underachieving rappers  ", " exactly. i didnt take personal offense to that. as a hip-hop artist in 2013 with the technology the landscape of the industry and the culture things are changing. were in a transitional period. we assume that editors of a credible magazine are intelligent people. we assume that these are people up on the state of things in the world outside of just hip-hop. leading up to that article i went to complex i played my albums for complex. complex was a big supporter from day one of my shit. but i started to see a change in the stance it was taking. it was almost like sarcastic\u2026it made me think do you guys even like hip-hop is complex a magazine that has love for the culture i started to see real sarcastic and degrading articles.  i understand being critical thats what keeps artists on top of their game. if they do some wack shit theres gonna be an honest write-up about their shit. what i got was that somebody in that building had a disgust for hip-hop. it was like a bougie stance from where theyre writing from. thats what i took offense to. i see a lot of that in our culture right now. this shit came from the streets. this shit came from the people. this shit came from the struggle.  i took offense to not only complexs stance but the major labels stance on how they treat artists how they treat the culture. and i felt like were at a point where our cultures getting exploited and its looking like theyre trying to do us like they did rock n roll. theyre trying to do us like they did africa and theyre trying to extract all of our natural resources for their own exploited reasons. if complex is going to take the stance to degrade the culture and point out every flaw that hip-hop artists have and every mistake they make then ima take the stance to say: as hip-hop were gonna boycott complex. we dont need that. we can write about ourselves. we could develop our own outlet and we can cover our own stories. its like no thank you. we dont need yall opinion no more. and thats why i said what i said.  ", " to clarify that list was based on artists we really fuck with who may not have had the output we wished they had. it was a critical opinion. we werent trying to bring anybody down.  ", " number one who is an editor to have an opinion on a street nigga bottom line. those editors dont live this life. they dont go through the struggle. im from the rolling 60s my nigga. they dont understand what putting an album out is to me. it aint the same as one of them backpack niggas or one of them college-rapping types. that aint the shit i do. i got enemies. i went to war for real in between albums. my life is real. so when i hear about an editor asking: whats up with my output im like: whats up with you even commenting on my life niggas dont know my life. thats the bourgeoisie approach that i get offended by because this aint no bubble. this aint no vacuum we doing this music out of. thats why people connect to the pain in it. because its real. thats the part they should respect. these radio hits these charts they dont validate the truth and the message. thats when i start to be like okay you aint got a record on radio. you aint put an album out officially so youre an underachiever.  thats where i get offended because lets restart this whole situation. the metrics and the gauge of success and of impact on the culture. it dont got shit to do with billboard it dont got shit to do with soundscan. it dont got shit to do with any of these platforms that the business created. this shit is a culture. this shit is our life. you understand so in between my projects does it take a year or two or another artist that live a real life does it take them a year to put a project out because he wants to retain ownership. he wants to do what they refuse to let you do and thats control his own destiny. he dont wanna be exploited by the music industry that been traditionally exploitive to our creators. then he end up on lists like the top 25 underachievers.  a lot of these artists that you got on these lists theyre living real life and come from real places. the fact that theyre not doing 25-to-life in jail yall niggas better salute that. the fact that niggas aint running up on shit robbing shit stealing shit\u2014niggas are being creative having a positive output. complex better respect that period.  ", " it sounds like you actually did take it a little personally.  ", " yeah. but then i realize i cant and i step back. thats why i didnt speak on yall when the list first popped up. i just stepped back and said thats yall right to do that. but im starting to see complex. yall cover all the shit you dont like about hip-hop. i stepped back and watched for months. ive come to a conclusion: complex dont love this shit. theyre not in it. they cover it from a bourgeoisie perspective. were judged by our peers. were not judged by somebody putting stories up writing an article. we dont even know your background. you gotta validate your opinion in the real world. you cant just walk on crenshaw and slauson and say i dont like nipseys project cause niggas gonna beat you up. who are you to say that im offended by the throw-a-stone-and-hide-your-hand operation of this industry. diss a nigga one month because you think his career is over. and the nigga turn around and shift culture and you ask for an interview. fuck your interview nigga. quote me on that. im an unsigned artist getting $25000 a show. im touring the world not doing nothing against the law getting money to feed my family. i got employees that have felonies and they cant get jobs. they work for me.  ", " to be fair as your fan\u2014and i told you my background\u2014i can tell that youre really from the streets. and i really fuck with your sound but i wasnt really feeling the marathon continues. we put you on the underachievers list because you dropped that in 2011 and disappeared. we didnt really hear from you until you started dropping the victory lap shit which has been fire by the way.  ", "", "  nipsey hussle rightfully made a name for himself in 2008 with his powerful bullets aint got no name trilogy which many expected to propel him to the forefront of west coast rap. but in the five years since other l.a. artists emerged to assume the mantle. this past august\u2014out of our disappointment not ill will\u2014we put nipsey on our 10 underachieving rappers list and he wasnt too happy about it. not knowing his displeasure i reached out for an interview so we could talk about the hype surrounding the recent release of his crenshaw mixtape and its $100 price tag.  after some back and forth and getting called out on twitter by nipsey himself who also demanded $10000 for a complex interview he finally agreed to get on the phone to talk to us with a special $10000 discount. and were glad he did. in our conversation he gave a scathing critique of our rap coverage discussed why his music resonates with people and explained why he refuses to budge from his anti-industry stance.  interview by angel diaz @adiaz456   whos making these rules up that you got to drop a project every six months who made these rules up i dont know where that came from. thats not indigenous to rap. thats what niggas start doing but im not a follower. and im not in it for these same reasons. niggas hold fame against you like thats what youre in it for. im not in it for fame. ive been famous in the streets already. my goal in this shit is different bro. what im trying to do in this rap shit is different. thats the reason that i priced my project for the price i priced it at. obviously its a business and were all trying to get the bread. but i really love hip-hop. i really love the culture of hip-hop. and if a nigga understands and listens to my catalog they can tell that. if they cant tell nothing else they can tell that.  i mean it gave me a legitimate outlet. it gave me a freedom to be able to do what i love to do and get paid for it. but even before that im a student im a child of hip-hop first. im an unsigned artist getting $25000 a show. im touring the world not doing nothing against the law getting money to feed my family. i got employees that have felonies and they cant get jobs. they work for me.  who are yall talking to whos the audience youre speaking to because you cant be speaking to the streets. the streets dont think like that. they dont bro. they dont think like he aint have a project for a couple months. nah thats not how the streets think. theyre like my nigga keep going. keep going because youre supposed to be dead. youre supposed to be in jail. youre supposed to be doing 25 with the rest of the niggas you grew up with. my presence is positive. my presence is law of attraction. mind over matter. thats really the fabric of my creativity.
