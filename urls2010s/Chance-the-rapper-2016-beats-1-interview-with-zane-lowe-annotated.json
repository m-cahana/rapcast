{"chance the rapper": [" is perfect because it wasnt the first record that we made for it but just like good ass intro it ended up being kinda like the thesis of the project right. so i had made a lot of records and i have a record called finish line that was gonna be the intro and  zl: thats crazy to think about that now  ctr: yea its that was a weird sequencing im glad thats not how it ended up being but that record is so much of the record because it talks about faith it talks about you know theres other blessings in the world and on the album but you know at the end of the day music is what we have you know what im saying and you know were blessed at all times but you know waiting on your blessing or thinking that your blessing is in an album is not what it is you know what im saying its there is no higher miracle in this project or in any of the material things in the world but the materials do exist. so the music is what we have and i remember i flew out to l.a. this was only like two months ago and i met up with donnie trumpet and nate fox who made most of the music that i make and they actually i wanna play it for you. so i had i dunno how its gonna sound in the interview but we had they had a record that they were working on with  zl: were gonna record this anyway so we can put the real audio through  ctr: ok perfect. so i was working on or they were working on this record with grace weber who i am in love with both musically and otherwise shes the best and she they had written the song for her for her album and she and they played it for me and it sounded like this at first  chance plays demo version of all we got  ctr: actually i havent heard this in a long time right crazy so the kicks were so different and it was so dancey  zl: yea totally its way more uptempo and way more dancey  ctr: and i remember when it got to this part where it says woah woah woah uh uh uh uhhhh uhhhh but i heard this and was like this is this is it.  zl: just that moment  ctr: after that i was like thats exactly what i need. so i was out here because kanye had called me when i was in chicago and said i wanna help you in whatever way i can and  zl: this was what was the timeline of  ctr: this was two months ago  zl: whoa so your work on pablo is done  ctr: my work on pablo is done and im working on my project now. i put a lot of time and effort into that album and learned a lot and gained a lot outta that and but i think that there was a lot that kanye had to do on his front the same place that i am right now where he was like ok all my personal life and all the other things that i need to do  zl: i need to let it go i wanna get back in the process  ctr: exactly. so he hit me and he said i got you i want you to come out for four days. and so like i said i got in i went straight over to nicos spot and they played me that record and i was like yo i know this is for grace i need this. i need you guys to help make this work for me. and i asked them if it was ok if i brought it by kanye. they said cool. so we all went over to kanyes spot and within a few hours of sitting around and having all these deep conversations cause thats what kanye does is he he does lectures and shit and theyre all theyre all like very insightful and important and helped me out a lot and but after about two hours of being there  chances phone rings  ctr: aw sorry my baby mamas facetiming me ill take it later. ok i will real quick  zl: go for it  ctr: lets see aw my babys in it too. hey im in this interview right now can i call you back babe oh im sorry its ok love bye. um now i cant remember cause shes gorgeous.  zl: exactly exactly haha and therein lies the perspective of life and therein lies all of this is total bullshit  ctr: at all times haha  zl: so youre hanging out with kanye hes giving you the deepness  ctr: i almost forgot so he basically asked us to pull up the track we pull it up he starts doing his kanye dance to it and hes like ok i fuck with it take off all the drums. so im like ok i dont really know what what that means but well take off the drums. so now its just horns synth and ye says uh pull out the mpc. so they bring out this mpc almost like in like the gold suitcase like from pulp fiction-  zl: ahhhh like indiana jones  ctr: like with just the ", "  quick links part 1. 0:00 to 10:00 - releasing coloring book making of all we got & demo part 2. 10:00 to 20:47 - faith francis and the lights & working with kanye part 3. 20:48 to 30:57 - waves and nina chop demos & being independent part 4. 30:58 to 40:28 - how

to 10:00 zane lowe: so this is conway studios off of melrose in los angeles. youve been here before.  chance the rapper: yea this is where we did a lot of the surf album and a lot of songs for coloring book.  zl: thats right pharrell does some recording here as well as beats 1 and this is a place with rich history and so were here today to talk about music and its the first time weve had a chance to properly sit down and meet and hang out. it feels good to finally meet you and especially now that youve dropped this amazing record and the reviews are coming in left right and centre and i dont know if you pay much attention to those things if anyones even given you a headline i mean theyre universally acclaimed.  ctr: thats dope i mean i havent read em all but i did see a bunch of them that were really nice and broke it down in a cool way.  zl: you seem really well very healthy obviously there was some concern and you had to come out and say look ive been under the weather you were hospitalised at one point i think you said it was pneumonia like what was that about  ctr: i dont know i just get really sick i think i need to like just take better care of myself i just i try and push it as far as i can  zl: i wondered if it was a creative consumption the stress  ctr: yea you know that and also i get tonsillitis a lot i dont know i just get sick very easily im just like mr. glass i dont know. i was sick and im getting better.  zl: whats the pressure like when it came to finishing the record like how close did it come to the moment when it was finally released on that thursday evening american time and when did you actually hand it in  ctr: we were to the limit like we were able to still turn in the album to our friends over at apple on time or a little bit behind time actually cause  zl: well what is time actually these days anyways  ctr: i know its a new idea to me also i think just turning in music for somebody to try and post it in a certain time and space. ive worked with end dates before like i had announced acid rap but we were in the studio until we posted it.  zl: and it was self-imposed  ctr: yea so it was kinda the same thing with coloring book it was just a little more stressful because of i think the environment that we created in that studio because there were so many different people working on it and everybody was sleeping at the studio we had all the inflatable beds there. it was like twenty people all living out of the studio space along with me and my girlfriend and my daughter and i think that there was a lot of you know just fatigue and tension and you know i think adrenaline of all of it like boiling down minute by minute and like the last time that we played it before we turned it in we were like its perfect its cool.  zl: hahaha i just think lyrically like the way you opened up acid rap you talk about how raps made you anxious and acid made you crazy. and then on this one you go straight in youre like talking about fatherhood and marriage and its like wow what a difference two or three years can make. have you had enough perspective since you released coloring book to be able to realise the journey that youve been on i know you threw it all into the album but now youve had a week or so to process that and you see how much life has changed.  ctr: yea i think thats the scariest part is not having the album to focus on as much because all of the real world problems arent there you know. so me you know not paying attention to my health for months on months on end you know its like all in your face or you know what im saying your relationships or  zl: youve got real life to deal with now  ctr: yea real life is like  zl: you had a great excuse before you could go three days without answering a call now its like whats your excuse now chance  ctr: exactly.  zl: haha lets talk now about the themes of the record a bit and the one that really jumps out to me you know is the relationship between art music faith and devotion right and the way that you brought church and religion to the record and were gonna talk about that. but i want you know first of all on this record one of the first major statements that you make you know is that musics all we got. now this is something that weve all thrown around in various conversations because either be in a lighthearted way like musics all i know its all im passionate about but this has more urgency to it and i wonder you know what the deeper meaning was to you with that lyric that you and kanye share on that opening track.  ctr: well that music is all we got is kanyes lyric right so that record []. and they put it on the table and he records drums in a way that ive never seen before he does everything live off the mpc. so all of his patterns that you know hes-  zl: so hes recording it like an organic drum kit []  ctr: exactly but that makes you know. as it plays now the drums arent like mixed separately its like all the kicks all the hi-hats everything are at the same level and shit. but he does it literally in one take so from top to bottom he goes you know he just stands there and just plays through it and plays all the drums that you hear on the track as they are now. and then less than 5 seconds after he does that one take through he goes through and freestyles over it.  part 2. 10:00 to 20:47 ctr: theres this guy named francis starlite whos  zl: francis and the lights  ctr: francis and the lights my god  zl: who by the way vocally on this record shines and adds a texture of emotion that is just out of control  ctr: thats the one perpetual thing through the album thats just is him and ive heard a lot of sounds with harmoniser right so one of my favourite things that i see on the internet is people commenting on the album as you know whenever they talk about this vocal sound that hes created they call it auto-tune. or they say this sounds a lot like bon iver. justin [vernon of bon iver] who francis worked with and showed a lot of this musical styling to uses a very similar harmoniser effect. but theres a very special thing that francis does that he called prismiser i love it and its gonna be on kanyes album and its on franks album but this prismiser thing that he does he sings and takes a vocal and then very similar to a vocoder he instead of being singular keys he builds chordal sounds around it so it sounds like a choir. so when you first hear yes vocal come in it sounds like fifteen cyborgs all singing in auto-tune but really its one vocal with francis saying ok this is the third and the fifth and the seventh []  zl: and he can play any note  ctr: yea and he just builds a choir around it and it sounds like  zl: is that what happens at the end of all we got as well so when it changes  ctr: thats him. so let me play you this freestyle that i got cause this is still crazy to me to this day  chance plays second demo of all we got  zl: how long have you known francis for  ctr: so me and francis met in i wanna say 2013 maybe 2014 right after i dropped acid rap ive always been a fran a fan of francis. these are those loud ass drums he put on here.  zl: []  ctr: you know what im saying this is just him at the board like this like... so this vocal is solo right and then... music is all we got  zl: freestyling  ctr: yea like just off the top. bom bom bombom. but this whole sound is like my favourite thing. because it resembles the choir sound that ive been trying to get but it also makes it kinda futurist at the same time. you know and thats i think one of the encompassing ideas of the whole project cause that sound is on francis is credited on summer friends but he also did all of the kanye vocals on it he also does the end of same drugs theres a whole part that he does and even though its not him playing on how great my cousin nicole came in and sang this lead vocal from how great is our god and my homie peter came in and did francis prismiser effect with his same harmoniser and preset that we learned from him and shit and really makes it sound like a whole new thing  zl: its like new church hall almost it sort brings a whole like you said modernises something which has been around for as long as  ctr: exactly. i mean thats the whole process of this thing is like putting god back in you know god back in our hands  zl: lets talk about this real quick because whats interesting to me is when you think about artists when you think about musicians in general religion has always played a very strong part in peoples lives. theres no mystery that faith in music and faith in god go hand-in-hand a lot of times. i can think of a lot of artists who are very religious but they guard it they guard it privately for themselves probably cause they feel it should be a personal experience. and im sure thats the case in rap too im positive of it. you know you are the devotion is on display on this record. thats really unique if you think about it youre not hiding anything its very very open you really are serving a purpose here.  ctr: yea i mean since i i think i mean all of this music that came from me moving to los angeles was a catalyst i moved out here at the beginning of 2014 and stayed here only for about four of five months but in that time i felt like i was kind of losing my god a little bit you know. and that separation got i kind of got rid of the feeling by filling every morning literally filling my whole neighbourhood with this kirk franklin sound we had the craziest speaker system we used to have this giant house in l.a. called uh we would call it coy castle. its this big dumb ass mansion that i shouldve never rented we had the craziest speaker system in there and every morning starting at 6 am id wake up cause id be on chicago time and wed crank kirk franklin through the fucking whole neighbourhood and that i think and from that you know that was the time i started making a lot of this music two years ago and it kind of carried through and led me to understand to know that my next project was going to be founded in god and founded in my faith. but i never really set out to make anything that could pretend to be new gospel or pretend to be the gospel. its just i think music from me as a christian man. i think before i was making music as a christian child and like and in both cases i have imperfections but i think there was a declaration that could be made out of going through all of the shit that i went through in the past two years.  zl: having been a christian child and having been a christian young man what do you think and this could be taken as a question im interested in your perspective even if its just a short one. what do you think god means to kids these days from your experience  ctr: thats a really good question. i still think that god means everything to everyone whether they understand it or not or can really see for themselves where they find god you know. but i dont necessarily i know for a fact that you know were not pushed or promoted to speak about god with fervor. i dont think that theres anything that really allows us to do it. but i think the new generation in the forward is all about freedom and all about the ability to do what we want and you know were not free unless we can talk about god.  zl: no youre all in youre all in. youre all in.  ctr: like lets go  zl: and the thing is when kanye came out and said that pablo is more of a gospel record then it is anything else and i think hes that assessment was correct in that there are definitely gospel feelings to that record. you know did you guys discuss it when you were talking about the importance of bringing back the community in that sense or at least audio-wise and sonically the community did you talk of that together  ctr: yea. well i think me and kanye both in the experience of working on the life of pablo both were able to grow and take things from it. and when i first came in like i was two years ago i was blasting kirk franklin. you know what im saying i was blasting fred hammond i was blasting byron cage and in that space kanye was working on his album but he was also allowing me to play my album in front of all these people. and we had conversations about faith and had conversations about god. and i think when kanye said that he was making a gospel album he did not mean gospel the genre at all. hes talking about literally the gospel in terms of telling a story. and repeating a historic happening and documenting it. and i think a lot of people kind of got lost in the fact that he had said it was a gospel album and i also rapped a whole bunch of historically christian bars on that right. but i think that the making of my album and the making of his album were very separate but connected in that we had a lot of good conversations together you know.  zl: you seemed very connected on that record. i mean would you i mean it feels good to me. would you guys work on something together in that ilk have you talked about working together on something thats even more gospel related and bringing that faith together on record  ctr: i think that the main thing that we wanna connect on is this project called good ass job. like thats a thing that we talked about a long time ago and i think everything that weve been working on together has been sort of a piece of it whether we were together in the room or not i think my intro for acid rap was called good ass intro and theres a sample from his get well soon mixtape and in a lot of ways all we got is the same thing. it wasnt necessarily that we sat down and wrote together in a room or that we bounced ideas in a traditional way. i literally like sampled ye. i literally took what he gave me in a session of freestyles and and sat with it and worked with it and worked with it and he had given me all the pieces that i needed to make what i wanted to make. and so i think moreso than like making a traditional project or making a traditional faith-filled project or anything like i think he just wanted to help me make the dopest shit that i could make.  part 3. 20:48 - 30:57  ctr: you wanna hear this original version of waves i made for ye  zl: yea  chance plays original version of waves  ctr: i had this big choir and this crazy arrangement for it he took out all the choirs. he kept my verses but changed everything else.  zl: thats crazy thats crazy woooo thats crazy  ctr: aint that funny  zl: so he came in and went no no no  ctr: no no no no yes. that was it. it was like no no no no no. yes. actually i also have a very funny verse from the nina chop song  chance plays original version of famous/nina chop  zl: by the way swizz this beat\u2014unreal  ctr: oh yea he went crazy it was so funny cause i hated this beat when i first got it from him and then i was like and then when we flipped it and i heard the final version i was like he was right this is way hotter than what we were doing  chance plays his original verse from nina chop  zl: i feel like you and ye is like too good chance laughs its like it has to be some truth thats told here. cause its great that theres a collaborative nature to your relationship but  ctr: its unfair isnt it  zl: lets talk about the way that you released this record and the way that youve released records in the past. much has been made of this independent streak and i think because even though were moving into a new world some of the old traditions have come with us. when did you as an artist or in fact even just as individuals realise that free for everybody was the path that you wanted to take that this was the point of difference for you  ctr: thats a good question zane haha. well i think that the free part of it is more of an attention-grabbing thing and something that people can use as a marker to kinda track what im doing. right i mean since day one since i was you know fifteen sixteen passing out mixtapes outside of my highschool i always gave them away for free and id get in trouble with my pops cause hed work to get this money and then id spend it to make these and literally give it away. i would always explain though that i wanted to get it to as many people as possible. i think after 10 day when i decided to make acid rap a mixtape and really like a really free mixtape and really went away from a lot of the deals i was being offered it was kind of to throw out a beacon and let everybody see what could come of a free artist. and i wanted people to associate those words and to see you know an independent artists independence  zl: truly independent  ctr: and just so you know its i dont it was never you know i wanted to look like i was very special doing these things or like im the only one that could do these things really. its all about demonstrating the abilities of a person with you know a good team around them and an idea of where they want to go.  zl: youre still on the outside looking in and having success on your own terms what does it look like to you because youre one of the only people that really is from your standpoint.  ctr: yea. i mean sometimes it looks like a sweatshop. and and i hate a lot of parts of it. but one of the things if i can shoutout kanye one more time that he helped me with was the understanding that you cant look at these companies as entities. you know these are all individual people making decisions and when people make wrong decisions you put a pressure to get that person pushed out but you dont completely down a company or an organisation. so with that being said i dont agree with the way that labels are set up. i dont agree that anybody should sign 360 deals or sign away their publishing or do or take most of the infrastructure thats included in a formal deal. but ive learned to not be like you know fuck this company and fuck this company even though a lot of those people tried to make it really hard for me to release my project.  zl: how do they do that how do they make it hard when youre independent take your business to the point where if one more label tries to stop me. that it becomes a hook.  ctr: well heres the thing most people are signed right so say say you make a project and theres twelve universal artists on it. and then not only do they find out after the fact that youve recorded with these artists and that you plan on making videos with these artists but they find out also on top of it that you plan to release it for free. so thats when you get phone calls where people are trying to tell you that they own your friends or that you cant make any decisions without them being a part of it. and you you know. i only use universal as an example because those are my people and they helped me get the project done. but you know for the people that arent named you know there is that kind of interference that happens when youre trying to push something out that people feel like they own. you know or trying to give something away that people feel  zl: yea its a lot of investors coming in after the fact  ctr: its a lot of suits and ties of people that dont know how the fuck to play notes telling you the value of what youre making or whatever youre doing.  zl: have you ever been tempted and i only raise it because there have been little hints along the way i mean even on the new record theres a couple of moments where you talk about you know kanyes best prodigy he never signed me and i wondered if that was ever on the table. and i think its angels where you say fuck it maybe i should sign to ovo was that that record where you said that  ctr: yea that is thats yea i mean ive had everybody has had that conversation. weve had all the conversations. and whats funny is that some of those conversations still keep coming back. but with kanye it was cool because he did offer me a deal but still worked with me diligently you know after knowing that that wasnt what i wanted to do. and i used the word prodigy because i cant really i wouldnt go as far to call myself kanyes prot\u00e9g\u00e9 because i didnt have that experience that some of my best friends got working right underneath him. i think that the word prodigy is cool cause like i was just a kid that he knows that and i am still a kid and am still growing and dont you know fully understand how everything works and my potential or what im going to do. but im i had the insight of ye being around me at the point where ive kind of already decided a path to be like yo you should sign. no youre not gonna sign cool lets get this money.  part 4. 30:58 to 40:28  zl: yea. you could sell music independently its not like one goes without the other there are a lot of independent artists who have sold their records and have sold them at a very competitive price in order to survive but also to not feel like youre causing anybody financial disservice as a fan. why the decision not to sell this record still  ctr: i think in part a big part of it is that we are at such a crucial time in terms of music i mean before i know its being highly publicised now this this you know the what is it the national recording arts and sciences i dont know what theyre called but those guys had been having a conversation i think up to at least a year ago about changing some of the verbage in their rules and how theyre inclusive of um  zl: awards charts all that kind of stuff. and theres been changes in streaming on the charts as well  ctr: yea so the charts are already changing theyre including streaming. i still dont necessarily agree with how they its something like every 1000 streams is a sale  zl: is like one purchase  ctr: or something i dont know i dont really care about that. but at least theyre making that move and i think the grammys started making the move i think about a year ago they started voting on it i dont know cause i dont really im not on grammy board anymore but they uh  zl: but you were  ctr: yea back in the day but they originally or the wording is that they cant nominate a project unless its released unless its a commercial release right  zl: right. and does it qualify now that youre on streaming  ctr: no. but thats the thing because of this timing i think it was important to have these mixtapes be trilogised and be a thing that existed. regardless of how the revolution goes you know i know that i was not on the bus when everything was changing. you know what im saying and i was like fuck it im still dropping mixtapes. now whatevers next i dont really know ive kind of am a little turned off from making music right this second cause im still sick and shit and i just did a project. but like you know i know that i did the three projects exactly how i wanted to and that they were mixtapes and thats where i came from.  zl: trilogys perfect. does it feel like now that cap has signified the end of that particular era for you in some respects  ctr: i think for sure. like i mean i wouldnt necessarily say that im not making anymore mixtapes cause i i like making mixtapes i might make a tape with jay electronica soon i might make a tape with anybody let me stop doing that.  zl: im excited.  ctr: thats cool and itll be awesome but i think for sure that mode of projects was its own thing.  zl: yea for sure.  ctr: and i had to make certain statements because i was in the climate that i was in but will like we were just saying when 10 day came out they didnt count streams. and  zl: things changed so much even since then.  ctr: yea and i think everything will continue to change but i think we do have to think about being inclusive in terms of artists that dont necessarily have a label attached to them or want to release music commercially cause that doesnt have anything to do with artistic excellence which is what they celebrate you know and because its you know where this is the shit moving forward you know its gotta move forward but let shit change you know what im saying  zl: lets talk about jay electronica for a second  ctr: yea lets do that for a minute.  zl: for a few minutes  ctr: for a few minutes  zl: we talk about about jay elec. i mean a guy whos sorta opens the door comes into the room for a hot second lays waste and then disappears again. so to have him on a song as powerful as how great is it still your favourite song on your work its really unbelievable man you know real emotional powerful piece of music. what i really love about that as well is just talking from a total rap nerds point of view for a second is that you almost chameleon-like adopt his flow for a minute in the beginning  ctr: oh yea completely  zl: deliberately you know to create a synergy. i love that. i was listening to it and was like is that jay elec at first and you were like da ba-da ba-da ba-da that sort of like tripping flow that he does.  ctr: what is it im trying to remember like oh candyman candyman spit me a dream. what is it blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream. yea so thats yea but no im probably - i mean somebody could fight me for it - but i feel like im jay electronicas biggest fan.  zl: haha now were all in that line  ctr: but its ive always been you know what im saying very for as long as i can remember like back to high school i was jay elec very tough. and hes a very well-read well-educated dude and-  zl: when he speaks its totally believable. cause hes at that point in his life where what hes talking about hes lived. thats unique.  ctr: definitely. i mean theres a line in his verse on the project where he says he says jay elec wouldve never made it o son of man o son of man. who is the angel that stood on earth with a foot on water and a foot on land who is the angel that rode a harley from the projects to the parliament and then that line im like who is that angel cause you know hes dropping mad spiritual text references these are joints that you really have to look up you might need somebody you has a degree in that shit to really know what the fuck hes talking about. the last line about riding a harley to the house of parliament i mean thats not a reference thats his life hes talking about himself like that shit really happened. and i dont know when that happened or what that means but like thats jay electronica talking about some really crazy spiritual shit that hes taking over and shit.  zl: hes really one of the greats and i think in many respects as frustrating as it is for us while we sit around and wait around for more music it just adds to that you know  ctr: well i think this was the prestige if anybody knows what im talking about i think or at least the beginning of the third act like hes in that space of like you know he had a song that i used to love where he has the sample its like elijah muhammad where he talks about like a king has to has to leave the people and go away and wait til he can come back and manifest its written his time.  zl: lets talk about juke jam on the record which is which is one of those songs which ive been reading a lot of press and reflections about the record and that ones bubbling up as people continue to analyse the album and pick their favourites cause are going so deep on this on the thinking process or thought process. and juke jam is one of those songs that people are feeling.  ctr: yea and i love that. isnt that weird though cause its well i guess its well that record is like very very chicago and like almost you know excluding you know i was kind of worried that people wouldnt really connect to the record cause its you know about a specific place that i think even certain chicagoans dont know about im actually sure of certain chicagoans dont know about.  zl: can you tell us more about it  ctr: yea i mean when i was a shorty we used to go to this spot down the street from avalon park called the rink and it was a roller rink but really it was a... have you ever seen atl probably not.  zl: no.  ctr: so theres like a movie called atl and they go to cascade and its like its the same thing in that movie its just like a place where like i did actually get into my first fight and got my first juke and like i theres obviously a giant roller rink on the floor but its about whats happening out by the lockers. thats like thats like the world that we was in.  zl: i think its cool that youve involved justin bieber in that song because you two have a friendship that goes back and there was a key moment i remember reading about when you know you guys were on the same stage at coachella and that was like a defining moment for both of you because what it did was it opened up the parameters of what was actually the perception of the two of you. it was like why is chance fucking with justin bieber and then why is justin bieber on stage with chance and like how does it work and like it was kind of cool.  ctr: yea thats my fucking boy like hes the shit and hes just very dope at everything that he does at writing at singing hes an amazing vocalist.  zl: how did you guys even meet like how did that happen  ctr: how did me and justin meet... me and justin met actually after we made confident so i wont say that me and justin were friends when we made confident but i was a fan.  zl: of course you were you wouldnt have jumped on if it wasnt.  ctr: exactly. and we met at coachella and hung out all day that day before i went on stage and it wasnt til like right before i went on stage that he was like  zl: that was the day you met  ctr: that was the day i met him we sat backstage and sm- and chilled  zl: hahahaha  ctr: and just chilled and then right before i went on stage he was like you want me to come out for a song and i was like yea lets have a dance battle. and we did  zl: thats crazy  ctr: and he crushed me. but only cause i was so tired id been performing the whole day  zl: real tired like tired  ctr: im cold in real life i probably just yelled on this microphone and shit  zl: its a cool record i really dig it i really like it. but you know what i also like is the fact that getting away from the famos for a second and talking about i wanna talk about some of the new people on the record too and you know the fact that youre always looking out for people that are gonna bring a different shade to what you do a different vibe to what you do. you know knox being a classic example.  part 5. 40:29 to 50:01 ctr: yea so i mean knox fortune is one of my favourite producers hes like been in the background and produced on a lot of records that i worked on and a lot of records for my friends and we you know have a bunch of collaborations that didnt really see the light you know. but that one that record [all night] was so dope because i had it for like a week before he touched it and it was just me talking on the record saying all night i been drinkin all night i been drinkin all night. and he was like yo let me touch that and brought it back and it was you know i mean hes hes chicago so  zl: what is it about chicago man like i mean its definitely one of the creative capitals in the world for music you know you could put it right next to sort of a manchester or a liverpool now of course people talk about toronto having its moment but you know there are places berlin there are places where music lives. why chicago why is it having grown up in it  ctr: i think i mean one its like just a very cultured place like you know we have you know chicagos a big city but its in the middle of illinois. you know what im saying and like all of the suburban areas around us like kind of like create this wall of like you know inclusive sound and shit and i think on top of that obviously its just weve never had a music industry and i think because there was no industry or big labels posted there it gave everybody a lot of air to like make what the fuck they wanted to make. and bred a lot of you know just awesome talent across all genres.  zl: theres one really funny lyric in there that made me smile on that song where you were like you just wanna talk politics and chicago shit  ctr: yea yea  zl: and that was just funny to me because its like ok you just released this records thats like totally dedicated to chicago all anyones gonna wanna talk about is chicago and now youve opened the flood gates this is it this is your time chicagos the new favourite here you go and already its like youre already over it hahaha  ctr: yea well like that song to me is the best song that ive ever written because its such an awesome concept. the idea behind it is that im at this party and theres women all over me and you know theres professionals in suits all over me and haha people that are telling me theyre my cousin and shit and in my mind all everybody wants from me is a ride home. and i think thats just such a funny stupid concept but to build off of it and to kind of make it connect in a way that you know now oh now you wanna chill now you wanna build you know what im saying now you got the bill. its its  zl: gas money cash money  ctr: exactly. all of that shit is a fun concept i think because i do get fucked up at parties and get paranoid and i think its just really funny to bring it back to just everybody wanting a ride... oh you my cousin no you wasnt hahahaha  zl: you made a record that is really a love letter for chicago its a positive uplifting listen for a city thats been well documented either by the conventional media front-face media which i call like the real kind of how would i call it like a modern media like vice have gone out there and done a piece on it youve got movies that have been made about it i mean theres a story about it being told right now. youve done it in a way thats uplifting which kind of contradicts everyone elses take on it. and i wondered what the challenges were in creating such an uplifting positive-sounding record during such a tumultuous time.  ctr: yea. well i mean theres definitely a challenge to it because it goes against public perception but its not a stretch. i mean chicagos beautiful people there are beautiful events happening all the time like beautiful music being made and you know there are like very dark shadowy parts of it and i think rather than you know vice documentary-style pointing at shit and being like isnt this weird its kind of like being you know just shedding light in all of those areas. like you know we talk a lot about 79th on the record because i want people to walk down 79th and sing 79th in a way that doesnt necessarily go with whatever spike lee made in chiraq you know what im saying and its not a lie you know what im saying its not like you know this this terrible dystopic place. im from there you know what im saying and im like the happiest again like im happy.  zl: what was it like growing up there  ctr: i mean its kind of hard because it was all i knew for so long i didnt start travelling til i was like nineteen or twenty but like its super communal. super small. everybodys a person away from knowing someone. everybodys cousin is somebody elses cousin. my mom graduated from kenwood and i know like everybody in hyde park because of it. my dad graduated from [] by my house because of it was the block club president. so like im very intertwined in this city in terms of like knowing people and knowing areas and shit.  zl: is there a movie to be made i know like you were very vocal about you didnt like the way chiraq presented the city but is there a movie to be made and is it something you could see yourself being involved in or in fact are involved in for all we know  ctr: i mean im not hmm. thats a good question. i think that the media that i make now is dope for chicago and i think there are amazing filmmakers in chicago that could make some type of think-piece. im not i wasnt critical of chiraq for the simple fact that i thought i could make a better movie. i just didnt think that that was any type of representation of the city it felt like it was written about somewhere else some fantastical place and then they just put it in my city. but i think my main goal right now is you now making music and ive kind of been getting into theatre a little bit like you know i want to write some type of think-piece for the theatre but  zl: would you do that on script-level as well as musical on multiple levels  ctr: yea i mean like i really like screenwriting like thats not something that im foreign to at all.  zl: and how many would you say that youve tried or attempted to write  ctr: two  zl: so youve finished two  ctr: yea theres one thats about a halloween party and then theres one thats like an existential like i dont know its like an up in the air thing where theres like this guy... i dont wanna talk about that one i don t know that im actually making that one but the first one  zl: halloween party stupid so we can call that by name  ctr: well call it the stupid halloween party  zl thats so fire thats the shit what an awesome name  ctr: haha no if i wouldve named it that  zl: back on the table cause of the name  ctr: lets go  zl: so as we sort of go through this has been fun by the way  ctr: this has been awesome. im chillin i keep forgetting were in an interview  zl: i want to talk about family because were both family men. ive got kids you have a newborn how old now  ctr: she just turned 8 months on monday  zl: congratulations  ctr: yea  zl: so this is youve documented this on the record which is again now a lovely tone on the album the honesty and just the vulnerability and the heartfelt nature of it. and i read somewhere actually in an article that the cover artwork is a painting of you looking at your daughter as well. so how has that experience been for you becoming a father  ctr: i mean its the greatest happening of my life and you know feels a lot like the beginning of my life  zl: right its hard to think about what you did before i have no idea  ctr: yea its crazy tripping. but i mean it definitely comes with all you know a lot of hardships and shit you know and i think its well documented on the album. one of my favourite records is a song i made with future on it called smoke break and i think future was perfect for it cause hes a father too and that record i remember i started making it and my girlfriend came in and she didnt like it at first now its her favourite song. but the song talks about you know its another song that uses drugs as a metaphor for relationships or sex or whatever but you know there really is a whole turning point in terms of your priorities and your schedule and we really did lose for a second you know the respect of time for ourselves and the respect of time to just take a break put the baby down for a second and like enjoy each others company.  zl: having been in and around somewhat of a political environment albeit local body politics in that situation and your dad working with barack obama when he was a senator and being exposed to that and i think that it makes sense now listening to your music and the way that you talk about chicago from the point of view of chicago as it comes from a community-driven place. what does it mean to you or what do you think it means to a generation right now because i mean in essence i think a lot of artists are saying things that people probably look to politicians and policy makers to say. you know and then in some respects those things arent really that forthcoming from a lot of political circles it seems to be in particular chaos right now internationally politically.  part 6. 50:02 to 60:53 ctr: yea i think there was always... you know i think the word politics you know sounds dirty to me when i even think about it. but i never really saw my dad as working in politics like whenever he whenever i went to his job or he talked about what he was working on i always saw you know that same idea of being a good man and working on projects that will help people. so when my dad took any job it was always kind of a state director position or a head of community outreach it was always about building a bigger communal space networking with all the all the the heads of religious organisations of community initiatives being in contact with and always on with people that are trying to make a difference and being spearheading really a lot of initiatives.  zl: you must be proud man do you know what he thinks about the record you just made and the music you play  ctr: i hope so im proud of my dad like thats what thats whats so funny is he says hes proud of me all the time and thats like thats a dope thing coming from somebody that moves shit in the physical you know what im saying. versus like i mean i do try and do physical shit but like i my shit is like a lot more  zl: well you have to get physical now we have to talk about the road bro. because the album is done. and its been a minute do you think about it are you in plans  ctr: definitely. so i mean like touring the music is going to be so easy just in terms of like the sound and pure audio of it and the sequencing of the show.  zl: it will be you and the experiment  ctr: yea. its always gonna be me and the experiment. that just works. you cant you cant say if it aint broke. do you know what im saying.  zl: is it gonna be the experiment and extended family  ctr: probably. yea. the last two shows i got to play with francis and the lights. people wont know that unless you were at those two shows but like you know. and i know francis is about to drop his album so i probably shouldnt even say that cause he probably wont be with me but still you know.  zl: put it out there.  ctr: you know like ive always wanted to bring a bigger theatre feeling to chicago. and when i say theatre i mean specifically like a broadway sense like new yorks theatre scene strives thrives because they have broadway and they have like a row of theatres and a very uplifted theatre scene. and i think  zl: is this something that will permeate through your terrain do you think  ctr: i think its on the other end of it just because its a stagnant thing. i want to build a building that people come in to like see you know like an attraction like the worlds biggest [] thats on the road somewhere and people drive to go see that.  zl: how hard are you gonna tour this record fans are gonna want to know. i mean youve been to europe youve been around america you havent been to australasia you havent been to probably asia  ctr: so well be in asia australia new zealand - can i say new zealand and australia or is that the same thing  zl: no theyre not the same thing  ctr: i knew theyre not the same thing i just wanted to check with you zane  zl: yep we categorically confirm we are not the same thing but were friends  ctr: and so so new zealand as well as australia. definitely gotta go back to europe. and i think a very important thing that were trying to work out right now is being in africa outside of being in south africa.  zl: amazing.  ctr: and then maybe well do something in america too. possibly.  zl: i hope so you imagine making this record...  ctr: wouldnt that be sick though  zl: ... just to not...  ctr: make everyone else travel for it thats the new thing is you gotta travel for music. thats why festivals are dope cause people go out of their way to go see a festival but thats the same shit i was just talking about.  zl: whens the touring gonna start do you know  ctr: i do know. i guess when this comes out the tickets will probably already drop so september.  zl: i got a couple quick fire things to get through before we get up and out of here then lets get some fresh air. so number one you mentioned something the other day when you were doing your reddit questionnaire you mentioned about the childish gambino mixtape is that ever gonna see the light of day  ctr: yea i know for a fact that its gonna come out by fall i think  zl: hes all nervous now i put him on the spot  ctr: the thing is i dont wanna say too much donald is like my older brother and like i can say some shit that will get me in trouble. hes working on his tv show so i should say that first. and atlantas amazing hes out there right now finishing up the tv show and the tape is not done or close to being done. but it will come out.  zl: youve got some skin in the game.  ctr: yep.  zl: no problem we have to talk about no problem because it is without a doubt one of the best songs of the year within the framework of the album.  ctr: thank you.  zl: i think i played it for like thirty minutes straight when we played it on beats.  ctr: you did. and thank you for that.  zl: thank you.  ctr: i got a lot of tweets about it they said they liked that.  zl: no the songs incredible obviously brining 2 chainz and lil wayne into it and creating such a really great chemistry on that record. it isnt always easy when youve got you know guest bars coming in sometimes it can feel as though its been sent in my tape or whatever or digitally. tell us about that song tell as what that song means to you and people have never heard you talk about it.  ctr: yea i mean that song is everything that its supposed to sound like its supposed to sound like the smash record that came from the other you know what im saying its supposed to feel like what this year is supposed to feel like when we take a chance on the other and fuck with you know what im saying some dope shit that came organically. and it is banging on the doors of all of those labels and letting them know like literally and figuratively like dont tweak. stop trying to stop what im doing you know im over here youre over there do your thing. but like in both ways dont keep doing it.  zl: but im gonna say it over the biggest hit record of my career to date  ctr: yea well i mean thats the way that you say some shit i mean i cant say it quietly in an email or like its i think that it meant the most to me to have you know to have wayne come on there and speak what he spoke  zl: great great verse too  ctr: yea i mean it still fucking scares me to this day to see that i have two records now with lil wayne. but you know what im saying i think to have him come in it and have him backing it up cause there is a chicago version of that record that will come out at some point and it does have you know what im saying the people i wanted to have on the record but this version made sense for the album  zl: chicago people  ctr: yea i dont need to say who it is itll come out. but its huge. its having them do it i think people that are juggernauts in the game stand next to me and also say like dont tweak on him. you know what im saying i think it was poignant and it made its way to everyones ears that it was supposed to.  zl: whos big fella  ctr: oh so you dont know who ha ha davis is of course you dont know who ha ha davis is. ha ha davis is the fucking funniest of all time. and hes from detroit and you know what im saying hes just like a comedian a new age comedian so hes on instagram is where we all watch him from. but ive been a fan everybody in chicago says big fella cause its some midwest shit at this point its some south shit now too like everyone says big fella. but i was a fan and i hit him up i think a week before we went to atlanta or actually like two days before we went to atlanta to shoot the no problem video. and i was like yo will you come with me just rock with me and we went out and just hung out together and met people together and now hes one of my closest friends. after he was in the video i was like yo will you narrate this whole project so he was on four out of like fifteen of the well he was on grown ass kid his main monologue is on grown ass kid which the labels they stopped me. it didnt make it on the project.  zl: can you just get it out anyway just find a home for it  ctr: i actually found out recently that the record leaked and its online but its official release is gonna be on cam obis project whos one of my favourite producers and did he did good ass outro the outro from acid rap and blessings on this new project like the reprise. and he did three records on this project that all got stopped.  zl: so much stopping  ctr: yea  zl: no more stopping.  ctr: yea dont try anything anymore.  zl: no more.  ctr: can i show you this big sean song that was supposed to be on the project that got stopped you probably couldnt play it on the broadcast cause it wasnt a cleared single.  broadcast paused while chance plays song privately  zl: its interesting cause like to me its dope as hell like i love that but its funny now listening to coloring book  ctr: you feel it wouldnt have fit  zl: it feels like  ctr: everything happens for a reason.  zl: crazy right still man hearing you and sean together.  ctr: it wouldve been perfect. its funny cause sean jeremih and cole all tour together and those are like my three best friends in music. and we had three songs altogether that were all collaborative songs and they all got stopped. luckily jeremih still ended up on summer friends but jeremih was on like three or four songs on coloring book.  zl: man the more you tell it the more i realise like were lucky we got anything at all.  ctr: yea  zl: out of the guests at least itll sure  ctr: itll never happen like that again though. all it takes is is i think the growth of the artists plural and the retraction of the control and then... i dont think i dont think there will ever be a release again from me that feels controlled.  zl: you dont want zero problems.  ctr: they definitely dont want a single one.  zl: hahaha. love you man.  ctr: thank you  zl: thank you  ctr: naw this was awesome.
