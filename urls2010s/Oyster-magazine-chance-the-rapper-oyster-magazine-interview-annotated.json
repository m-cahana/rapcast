{"chance the rapper": ["", "      chance the rapper might only have graduated from high school in 2011 but he has already dropped two critically acclaimed mixtapes: 10 day and acid rap. the latter was downloaded 50000 times within 24 hours of its release and garnered praise from kanye west james blake and j. cole a bootlegged version has even found its way onto the billboard charts. im sitting in a booth at lou malnatis pizzeria in chicago with chance the rappers manager pat. hes got a rugby-player build and shoulder-length blond hair. he orders a shirley temple which arrives minutes later filled to the brim with glistening maraschino cherries. chance walks in. he moves like a mixture of clown and robot. duck-footed in bright red adidas sneakers hes jerky and just a little too aware of his movements. his rail-thin girlfriend kirsten trails him. his first statement on the record is screamed into the dictaphone: fuckballs  its weird to think that the awkward youth before me has earned high praise from the top tiers of the music industry. in three days he will embark on a 40-date us tour with mac miller followed by a 23-date european tour with macklemore and ryan lewis. his lollapalooza after-party sold out in 47 minutes the fastest sellout for one of chicagos premier hip-hop venues reggies.  the dopest feature on  acid rap  is probably twista he tells me when i ask him which artists he admires. we had a little show at a shoe store and when i got there twista was performing. i had to go on next and when we were passing by he was like you killin it right now and i was like oh my god - youre twista after the show he was telling me he listened to my shit and he was talking about how he knew brain cells word for word and all my old shit. when me and vic  were working on that cocoa butter kisses track i was like you know who would be raw as hell on this song twista. i called him and he was like send it right now. it was crazy because he was really into it like can you hear what im saying in this verse can you get the verse do you like this one part should i change this is it good enough like what bro youre twista its a-ok with me.  i do think that theres some sort of structure in the way that everything is he says regarding the events that led him to this point in his career. i feel like were very in control of our own destiny but i dont know if that necessarily means that were loose in the world or theres nothing controlling us. what are the chances that this kid named chance who graduated from high school with a 1.3 gpa...ive seen some really crazy shit happen. ive been a part of some really crazy shit and am still a part of some really crazy shit. i dont know if i could that its all up to chance.  wait -- chance or chance  that its all up to me. i feel like theres gotta be something \u2014 somebody \u2014 somewhere putting people in the same room as me or putting j. cole in the same elevator as me making me say alright ill go here. dont you ever have that intuition moment of like a sixth sense telling you to go somewhere  my stomach grumbles and our cheese sticks arrive. our waiter whom chance likens to the bad guy in the first  spiderman  movie and therefore dubs scumbag brings over some ketchup. im a ketchup and cheese stick guy he says with a grin squirting a red mound onto his plate.  most of the shit that happened for  acid rap was in the last three or three-and-a-half weeks before the tape dropped. those last few weeks i was like oh shit i have a tape thats supposed to drop in less than a month i have to finish all of it now so i just stayed in the studio like every day. it takes me a long time to write \u2014 sometimes six or seven hours to write a verse. i spend so much time scratching shit out and stuff but i also have really bad add so i cant pay attention to shit for too long. i used to be prescribed adderall but i never used it.  chance is definitely easily distracted. he reads twitter throughout our interview scrolling constantly as we talk.i sneak a peek at the screen and texts are coming in from j.cole in extra-large font because chance cant fucking see at all. the two are making plans to hang out later but then his phone dies so he tells me about the first album he got into.  kanye is the reason i make rap music. the college dropout was the first album i ever owned \u2014 the first piece of music that was mine that my mom bought for me and gave to me. ive never been to a kanye concert. i had tickets twice but i missed both of em. both times i got in trouble. i used to be in a lot of trouble when i was a kid.  that wasnt so long ago. chance the rapper came up with his mixtape  10 day  when he was suspended for ten days in his senior year of high school after being caught smoking weed in the school parking lot. so really all that troublemaking might have been for the best. what kinds of mischief did her get up to while creating  acid rap  i did chain smoker and lost on acid he admits. i never wanted it to be like im a good rapper because i do acid. i was going through something at the time and i feel the music is supposed to document who the artist is as a person and their outlook on life at that moment.  if we dropped acid together he says wed listen to james blake and hiatus kaiyote. wed also listen to  acid rap  while hed point out all the crazy things that you never noticed about it and all the weird things that i put under the track like the little subliminal messages. im telling kids to kill their parents hes joking i hope.  what sucks is that when youre an artist and you get known more people know you for your music and know you for a certain aesthetic and the world kind of pushes that on you. so every time i meet people they only want to talk to me about acid or they want to give me some free acid. its cool when you first get into it but then you kind of realise over time its not necessarily who you are. it might be something you do but its not at all who you are.  he stops and stares at the piece of pizza on his fork. i ask if somethings wrong. yeah the tomato was looking weird. i was thinking about whether or not i was...thank you he says and eats it anyway.  i think ive kinda gotten to a point in my life where im happy a lot without dropping acid he says. i ask if it has anything to do with his girlfriend kirsten whom his song interlude thats love was written for. chance says theyve been dating for years and years and years; pat says six months. tomato tomahto chance replies. a week and a half. no ill stop making joke. kirsten changes the subject to shaving her legs and pat recommends laser hair removal.  i might do it to my pubes chance declares. i got like some serious problems going on with entanglement...i thought that was funny. as it came out of my mouth it sounded grosser and grosser. he picks up a pen to sign the bill but instead stops and shouts i dont sign autographs  "]}
