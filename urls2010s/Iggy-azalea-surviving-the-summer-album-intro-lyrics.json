{"iggy azalea": ["  you promised me a fake plastic love told me to be organic then laughed when i started to wither sipped on synthetic happiness pool side at the standard and didnt call me back summer you aint shit  i tried to be a mother warm but tough like noon concrete i tried to be a brush painting you in better light i tried to be a wave; when we fight rising and retreating i tried to stop the blue plumes billowing doubt from my texts inevitable conclusion; hes leaving me for summer  im scared of crashing a plane on the runway i worry about peoples negative energies im anxious about barbershop talk and internet memes i fear loving me has become inconvenient what if summer arrives - and im still waiting in line for happiness  "]}
