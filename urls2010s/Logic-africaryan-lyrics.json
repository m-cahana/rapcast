can i give humanity atom: i suppose so god: live your life. dont waste your days on the negative energy of others. remember that youre not your salary. youre not your house. youre not your car. and no matter how big your bank account is your grave is six feet under just like everyone elses. so enjoy the days you have. worry not bout the days that came before you. nor the ones that will follow you

the betterment of all kai: damn man weve been walking forever thomas: well thalias tracking system says well be there in just over an hour kai: shit at least we got good walking music or is that it thomas: oh no man. im cueing up the fourth album now his final one  "], "j. cole": ["", "   one two three four one two three four listen look into my eyes tell me you could see beyond the smile that im puttin on this front that im puttin up for you i spill my soul into a microphone with poems written in blood in hopes that its enough for you do you love me yet do you love me yet no okay ill go harder for you in fact i rap till i collapse all i wanted was acceptance my latest lesson ill never feel your approval till i accept my own come from a messed up home destitute and less informed about the ways to raise a child up to not become a product of his environment i need to cry and vent but i done built this wall up actin like everythings all good but in reality im lookin for something through bumpin my favorite rappers i came up after nas cole and hov eyes closed i zone till five or so in the morn im used to being alone shit you know how long ive been out on my own chasing dreams fantasies of a throne one day i wake up and see that it didnt exist all along till then i will pen verses that fans consider brilliant boosting my ego with every million that spills in and still then i wont find solace so wheres the logic in that worrying bout if they think logic could rap when it all goes back to a childhood need to be loved by parents that was in too deep with the drugs nigga my advice fuck the black and white shit be who you are identify as a star no one tells you youre that its something that you just know the world be stealing your glow your mama did what she could her life was miles from good your father fell in the trap they set for you when you black they met when they was low and therefore you a product of that and so your trauma is deep dont bury it you should weep and clean it out of your system then truly forgive em just my opinion only then can you find peace just start to notice happiness dont come from album release ive been through it before can only share with you what i know to be true but at the same time ill never be you and youll never be me no matter how hard that you try this is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly the truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky but if you want to then you ought to know why are you running from something with hopes of becoming someone thats finally worthy of love let me tell you now youre worthy enough fuck approval from strangers that shit is dangerous as hell find god learn to accept yourself and im gone accept him  "]}
