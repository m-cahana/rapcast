{"childish gambino": ["  to \u2026  ", "", "  whats really cool is how donald is seemingly playing a character the boy whilst also being himself. for a long time prior to the release of the album donald wore the same outfit as worn by the boy. twitter has played a role in this how donald will go from an interaction like so \u2026    which translates to dont ever wake me. the original language is swedish of sweden where the boy visits in the script yet chances interaction with donald was definitely out of character mentioning how it was a movie and they were acting. even in the short film clapping for the wrong reasons chance mentions donald by name. if clapping for the wrong reasons is a 100% canon then all the secrecy of the boys name is gone so maybe it isnt completely canon  in the short film at one point someone enters the house and kicks their shoes off into a pile of other shoes. this is what the boy does in the script when he returns home from camp.
