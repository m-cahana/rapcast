{"logic": ["  so how this verse came about almost two years ago when i wrote this record the first half i was on tour and i remember it being in the front of the tour bus and just looking at the open desert and just kind of writing this rap. uh kebu from atlanta originally did the first rendition of this song um with the sample that we later replayed um thats when i brought in dj khalil... and it was kind of just the fun braggadocios-ness of hip hop yet really beginning to tell my story as well - just in the flow the cadence kinda just showing off skill um but still telling that story and painting the picture of where the album conceptually was headed  on the second half uh thats where you know you really get into uh just the mental state of a hungry emcee you know releasing his first album. so for me um this song is just damn near six minutes of hip hop you know the emcee - who i am and how i want to be perceived.... as an artist  "]}
