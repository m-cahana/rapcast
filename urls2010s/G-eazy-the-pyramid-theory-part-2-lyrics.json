{"g-eazy": ["  climbing to the top  yo so i got a lot of feedback from a blog i posted a couple weeks ago where i pointed out the cold truth in terms of where exactly money is being made in hip-hop\u2026 and how everybody n their grandmama seems to rap but in reality only half a percent of them are actually seeing profits from music\u2026 if you havent read it already go read it now\u2026 real talk\u2026 like now\u2026  cool 4sho\u2026  u finished reading yet  aiight\u2026 so if you just read that and u still think youre trying to make it\u2026 then youre extremely optimistic or just doin it for the luv. either way first you should realize that the odds are extremely against you and that if you even want to make it into the third section as a regional star youre going to have to have a few things going for u\u2026  number 1 \u2013 absolute 100% dedication of your time and energy  \u2013 you cant half ass this shit for a second so if youre not about spending all your free time writing songs workin in the lab promoting etc then its not gonna work. if youd rather spend your time at the mall at the movies or playing madden then go find another line of work  number 2 \u2013 be humble and respectful  \u2013 this is very important: rappers stay off your own dick its important to have confidence but in order for anybody in this industry to wanna take a chance & fuck with you managers booking agents graphic designers etc youre gonna have to be cool as fuck. nobody wants to work for free with a pre-modonna who thinks that everybody should automatically cater to them because their that dope.  fuck that. nobody owes you shit in this world and youre gonna need help so be cool and act right and youll get it  number 3 \u2013 a full time producer and a studio on deck \u2013 basically you need a situation where you can make as much music as possible at the lowest input price without having to pay a grip for beats and lab time because chances are youre going to have to make a lot of music before you get a real hit. no matter how talented you are. unless you have your own lab and make your own beats this is also gonna take being cool and respectful cuz some producer and some engineer is gonna have to give you free beats and lab time  the most important thing is be humble and respectful\u2026 real talk\u2026 ive produced/worked with at least 50 rappers in my career and all of yall think youre the best at what u do. true a lot of yall are talented but whats talent if everybody can string together punchlines and drop a hot 16 it takes more then that  also when it comes to paying dues dont ever get impatient. if youve got a situation where youre comin up underneath somebody bigger than you and youre getting frustrated cuz you want to be the star shut that shit up. take whats being given and make the most of it. either that or go out on your own and make it happen for yourself  if you are gonna do it all yourself tho do as much as you can on your own that way when checks start coming in you wont have to split them with a gang of folks. try & make your own beats your own graphics heavy myspace promo etc. its gonna take mad time on a computer\u2026  which brings me to my next point to be successful in 09 u kinda have to be a computer nerd to an extent\u2026 the game is all digital now all that sellin mixtapes and physical cds is all but over with. the more you can promote your music online the better. if you dont have an online presence its a wrap. selling mixtapes at the mall is getting you no where. gaining an online fan base and selling your music on itunes is the truth  yo so thats the game. be smart & get on ya job if u wanna shine in 09  1  "]}
