{"earl sweatshirt": ["  at the start of each issue we all sit down to brainstorm potential profiles and features; mike tyson has been on this list since issue one. with the article now realized the ideas that everything happens at the right time for good reason and nothing great comes easily ring all too true. when the opportunity to do a feature on him became a real possibility for this issue the question internally became how to share a side of mike tyson that is different from the countless interviews articles biographies both authorized and unauthorized documentaries and films to date. we all agreed that our best shot at having a unique angle would be to find the right person to interview him and thanks to leila steinberg earl sweatshirt of odd future agreed to the task. on november 4th we took a flight to las vegas where earl sat down with mike. there were many times when this interview could have fallen apart both in the days and weeks leading up to it and even after we arrived but it happened and the results were worth every moment. i didnt know much about mike tyson prior to this experience but what i learned from him is invaluable. that is not to say he is without faults like all of us but hes the first to admit them and his honesty openness insight strength and perseverance make him someone i greatly admire. i hope you find the following conversation as rewarding as earl and all of us at humanity do.  mike: how old are you man earl: im 20. mike: what do you have to say to me earl: so i got presented with the opportunity to come talk to you. mike: yeah.  where are you from earl: im from la. so i was trying to figure out kind of what angle to start at when i first got approached with this. mike: are you now earl: well the first thing that came to mind after doing just a little bit of research that i did was just some of the parallels that \u2013 just between me and you that i thought we had just at 20. just with being in the position that you was in. mike: i mean youre pretty much an idiot at 20. earl: right thats what i feel like. i got to 20 and i - mike: youre not an idiot but you are. you dont really think youre an idiot but you are. earl: right. mike: but you dont think it. like youre in agreement but youre an idiot. earl: no i swear i was talking to someone yesterday and i said the mark of me being an adult was when i got to the point where i realized how little i knew. mike: oh man. im humbled with that every moment of my life.  i think i know a lot but i dont know anything. i think i know a lot; they talk about a lot of subjects and issues but in the scheme of the world its really not even a grain of salt. earl: so i just thought you would have some real valuable insight just to give to people who are in positions like mine or just similar to mine where youre just a young person getting pulled from every single different direction. mike: whos pulling you record companies and stuff earl: well at first it was record companies and then when that kind of settled down it was management. mike: what do you need management for when you think about it whats the purpose of management in boxing in my opinion. for boxers i think they i dont know theyre glamorized babysitters. earl: yes 100%. mike: so they say hey come here. we gotta go here. we gotta go there. we gotta go here. we gotta go there. you have to give 10 or 15% of your money whatever it is\u2026 earl: to think for you almost to handle like kind of mindless duties. mike: yeah youve thought about that too earl: yeah. me and leila always talk about that she tells me all the time i am unmanageable. just because i am reclusive and i am the worst at communicating. mike: well that could be good too. because the most important thing in the world for show business really you know everythings a high-tech business but what people want now is what they cant get \u2013 exclusivity. you know when youre exclusive you know what i mean. earl: its the allure. mike: yeah. earl: its what draws people to you. mike: none of us are really who we appear to be. like me talking to you this is not who i am. earl: right. mike: were in an interview. this is not who you are. we are never who we appear to be. earl: mhmm. mike: and yeah but like you said its the allure exclusivity. the less you give the more they want. earl: its what has worked with so many people. i dont know if you know one of my favorite artists andr\u00e9 3000 like he has dropped probably 10 or 15 songs that fans of his know every single word to as opposed to like 1000 songs some is good some is bad.  a testament to the exclusivity. mike: yeah he is a big-time guy. earl: because he does so little. mike: sometimes people have reasons for being that way something that youre hiding sometimes just like \u2013 some people dont want people to know them because theyre vulnerable. they have no more power they feel. earl: thats true. i think mine was more gradual because i used to be a much more social person. and when i was 16 i got sent away for bad behavior by my mom. mike: what did you do earl: i hadnt done anything specifically but it was just like - mike: did you break the law earl: i broke the law but it wasnt so much that she was worried about my identity you know what i mean and just how i was establishing it. like the man i was becoming. so i had to spend that year and a half just like searching for myself you know what i mean just like figuring myself out. mike: we dont know at 20 years old the man we want to be. i just recently found out the man i wanted to be in life. i said this is the guy i want to be. and i realized everything i did in the past prevented me from being the person that i wanted to be so i dont do what i did in the past anymore. but it took me to be what 45 47 48 to really get it so its not like im some genius. i learned from experience no one told me to follow anybody elses example i had to feel the stove to realize it was hot. some people say im an idiot because it took me this long to get it and some people can get it right away some people take a long time. but i got it at least i got it some people never get it. i grasped it. i realized im not in the streets im not in the clubs no more you know im not sleeping with strippers or anybody like that. earl: right. mike: but whatever it is im just not doing that. i never really knew what dignity was until recently. and i realized that more so not because of myself but the response i get from people you know a woman wont have to worry about talking to me and worrying about me hitting on them anymore or anything like that. earl: and thats gotta be the best feeling. mike: yeah it makes me feel good because when you sleep with so many people all my life i thought that was adding to who i was but it takes so much away from you. mike: you know anger is my biggest enemy in life. i do a lot of reading on the history. i read the history the whole history of the world you know from the beginning. and we have so many people a lot of people. but do you know what we did more than fornicate earl: fight mike: war yeah. we fought more than we fucked. aint that crazy  we got billions people on the planet. even from the beginning from the beginning of time when that book starts fighting what are we getting into now fighting fighting\u2026from all that fighting great names great great great names them fools be fighting you know like george washington all the great names all these names came from fighting. and what for\u2026 earl: fighting against something. mike: yeah themselves. earl: some were fighting for like civil rights you know \u2013 like its all fighting. mike: i think war is led by faith. i never think of physical fighting. its always spiritual. fighting is spiritual. earl: absolutely. yeah. i got familiar with that concept early just because my mom she was always working so she dropped me off at this martial arts dojo. and the dude instilled \u2013 we had to meditate for an hour every time before we did anything. we would meditate. just to connect to the spiritual side of it. and like going inside of yourself and realizing the immense power that lies within you just as a person. mike: you know young man; its all about spiritual awakenings. i could never stop drugs i could never stop drinking doing stuff until i received my spiritual awakening. now its not a problem anymore. but ive been doing this since the 90s late 90s and i never could stop but i never understood the spiritual awakening. and once that comes into play its really eye opening. earl: its so much bigger than human constraints. mike: youve got brothers and sisters earl: yeah i do. like my friends are my brothers. like my real close ones. i got them like that. and i got siblings on my fathers side. mike: tell me about you man who you are whats your shtick man. earl: i do music. so i came - mike: like songs and stuff records and radio and stuff earl: not so much radio. i was fortunate enough to \u2013 we like developed our own like self-sustaining like fan base that was separate. so when i was like 14 i was getting better at rapping like running around l.a. trying to find like people to do music with. and i linked up with this dude tyler. and he had this whole thing going on already. we started making music and it was like it was idiot music but it was really i think what we had in hindsight what attracted so many people to it was potential. like we werent necessarily talking about anything but the way that the music was it was like sophisticated in a sense for our age. so anyways were doing that. mike: whats the name of your music earl: the group that i was in was called odd future. so we was doing that. fast forward 2010 so i want to say that was like 2008 to 2010. mid 2010 i got sent away. and we blew up. like at that moment it was like hand in hand. i got sent away and - mike: tell me what you mean by blow up. i know what blowing up means but how did you experience\u2014define blowing up. you got signed they played your music earl: yeah they started\u2026 but it wasnt even so much that they played our music on the radio it was \u2013 mike: clubs earl: it was like \u2013 it was almost punk rock in the way that it took off. it was just kids became like obsessed with it because they - mike: you a crunk dancer earl: nah\u2026we didnt dance too much but it was \u2013 they got attached because in the same way that that punk expressed like the angst of being a teenager so well a lot of our music and early energy had a lot of those elements. you know that teens really attach to you know what i mean \u2013 just illogical\u2026 passionate unaimed anger you know. like i dont even know but im just swinging. mike: whens your birthday earl: february 24th. mike: is that pisces earl: yes sir. so i get plucked out. it blows up while im gone. the whole time that i was gone for the first year i went to hell. it was the worst. because i wasnt involved. mike: well how exactly you wasnt involved because you werent there physically earl: i wasnt involved i wasnt there physically i was mad. mike: but you were in the group; you were a member of the group on paper right earl: yeah. mike: did you receive your money earl: i mean\u2026 i got money but it was from when i signed my advance with the label. mike: i aint never loan friends money; i give it to em and i dont expect to get it back. even when he says ill pay you back i never expect it. if he gives it back then hey thats a feather in his cap but i dont expect to get it back. earl: thats where im always at. im never\u2026i was never even mad about it. i was just\u2026 way more obsessed with preserving the friendship. mike: listen you know sometimes thats a really an intense word friend. you know sometimes during a relationship a friendship a friends gonna have to prove theyre your friend and youre gonna have to prove youre their friend. you know sometimes the people we invest the most time in disappoint us the most. earl: absolutely. this is the best way to summarize the situation. mike: in order to really be a friend to anybody this is what ive learned in life and my experience only not because im a genius but that im saying some slick shit. i endured a lot of pain from this. in order to be a friend to anybody you have to be a friend to yourself. if youre not a friend to yourself theres no way youre gonna have any friends. earl: if youre stepping on yourself then everyone else follows suit. mike: you have to be a friend to yourself. you know cause if youre not a friend to yourself youre an enemy to yourself and if someones a friend of everybody they are an enemy to themselves. you know you cant be everybodys friend you cant save the world i learned this word: self-preservation. once you do that you can be friends with people but how would you be a friend to anybody if youre not a friend to yourself. earl: its like the same reason why they tell you to put the mask on yourself before the baby on a plane. because if yall both dead because you was trying to help the baby then what mike: exactly you need to learn independence. you have to be independent \u2013 it builds character. you have to compete in life because if you dont have no competition \u2013 no competition no spirit you know youll fall under the slightest struggle\u2026 you know. earl: absolutely \u2013 one thing i always try and tell dudes that are younger than me is that because of the internet everyone can just be by themselves doing something but the importance of a group is being able to have some sort of competition. mike: no doubt about it. you know times have changed now because i grew up pretty much in the 70s late middle 70s. i met all my friends in the early 80s and met all my friends from fighting with them. earl: yeah. mike: most of them from the streets we loved each other to death wed fight for each other do anything\u2026we even shot at each other. you know were in different cliques and we shot at each other. its really bizarre if you think about it. its really bizarre. and i dont know how it works but it just works. it just works. friends are very \u2013 thats a very interesting word\u2026 human beings are a bad lot yknow. earl: were some of the worst \u2013 yeah i sit around and think sometimes about the constraints of being a human being. mike: you have to experience life. this world thats one big school out there. outside is one big school. you know earl: it gives you a ph.d. in common sense. mike: common sense is so very simple but very difficult to grasp. earl: psh tell me about it. its crazy how many people are absent of common sense. mike: its all about the basics. if you cant remember the small things how are you going to remember the big things man- you know the mind is a real dangerous neighborhood to travel by ourselves. you think the hood is bad try hanging out here by yourself. earl: its the worst. its the worst man \u2013 i always say you can always spot an addict by the person that cant stop talking. cause they cant be in silence. there cant be an idle moment. mike: you can tell when an addicts lying too. earl: always. mike: you know why because hes talking but thats what the ego is meant to do. the egos mean hes gotta to be crushed. thats what i need i need my ego crushed. smashed obliterated. but my ego has given me everything that i have. my egos given me fame. my egos given me hundreds of millions of dollars the most beautiful woman in the world \u2013 how can i let this go are you fucking nuts how do i crush it how do i let this go earl: dude ego is my career. rap music is all ego. mike: how you let it go you know it has to be crushed but it gives you everything you want but it takes back so much more in return. earl: i feel like \u2013 i was lucky enough to get my ego crushed when i was like 16. when i got sent away. mike: you know youre only 20; youre not crushed yet. earl: true - mike: itll be in hibernation for a while but it comes back thats just how it is \u2013 it comes back to help you it gives you confidence. gives you a full sense of courage. it just does all that stuff. but it goes too far sometimes. you know you cant control it. its all about being in control. like your mind \u2013 if you did everything your mind told you to do you do some really strange stuff. youll probably be in jail youll be in trouble. but you know its all about control. we all have to control our feelings. thats the thing that separates us from animals. earl: one thing that my mom told me that stuck so much that i feel like relates to what you was just talking about is there being only two real primal emotions \u2013 fear and love. and like the only thing that can combat fear is action. and theres two actions. theres fight and flight. mike: theres nothing to fear but fear itself. its an illusion of fear. fear is an illusion. if you gonna die you gonna die anyway; its not something to fear fear is not gonna help. its going to be over soon. somebodys going to die or somebodys going to get sick someone might leave. its not going to last forever. you know its going to be over soon. you know the thought of that never enters my mind. this is the reality of life. i watched that movie the notebook. you ever watched that earl: i havent watched it. mike: ah young man i dont even know if you understand that stage of life yet. very interesting thing about that movie very interesting its one of the movies that makes me really vulnerable. it makes me very vulnerable because you work so hard for something and you dont want to let it go. earl: mhmm. mike: let me see. for instance this is really interesting. it boggles me sometimes i always wondered the way we determine our age. before julius caesar because he made a year 365 days how could we detect our age how did we tell methuselah was 900 right so back then it was probably weeks or something. so how did we detect how old we were determine how old we were before julius caesar was born earl: before there was like a year system mike: yeah hows that one thats pretty tricky now you think so we dont know how old we are. earl: everything was based on the sun.  the sun. setting rising over the course of the year over the horizon. mike: many moons right but when it comes down to really deep down we dont know anything. we dont know anything. nobody was actually there to tell this is what actually happened. you know no one can tell us; this is the real reason why lincoln freed the slaves. no one can really say anything they had to be there you know to tell us. when you think about it the world is what we dont know how old the world is. but the written word is 6000 years old. six thousand years is a blink compared to the world and the activity in the world. six thousand years is nothing. nothing. earl: thats why all we got is right now. mike: yeah the moment. theres no future in our past. just experience. you know we want to return to it but we dont want to close the door on it either. you know thats information so we dont make the same mistakes.  theres nothing wrong with making mistakes just dont make the same ones. we dont want to duplicate them. earl: ive got a quick question for you. one of the things i thought was really interesting you said in your documentary was: theres nothing like being young and happy and fighting. it sounds like such a contradiction you know to be happy and fighting. mike: right you know this is interesting that you say that. thats wild. because when people see me and they say im coming back from what they say is the doldrums or disaster or something. but listen youve got to be happy now. im not happy because i have received such success im happy because \u2013 im not doing anything deceitful i think to my family. im successful because i dont have to sleep with one of my friends girlfriends or wife or something. thats why im successful thats success to me. im not dead im not in the gutter \u2013 thats success to me. earl: and its a profound statement because if youre happy you enjoy what youre doing. and when you stop it just means youre just going through the motions. mike: absolutely because you go through the motions and you are still successful. until you run into someone whos happier doing what hes doing. earl: exactly. so my question was at what point did you stop being happy like when did you start feeling that you were clocking in mike: wow thats awful you know. really early in my career probably 14. earl: my last question mike when you like achieve success like you have how does that affect those around you \u2013 how do you get them to be motivated and not feel content mike: its just strange to me how i have such a profound passion for my kids. i think about just wanting to protect them. \u2013 you think id ever let my son fight a 14-year-old kid or something like me that has nothing never had nothing earl: because he comes from a different place. it comes from desperation. mike: i look at my beautiful son hes so beautiful and handsome. and i think what a guy like me would do to this face. i would choke it take a chunk of meat out of his head bite his beautiful face. i would hurt him and im just looking at him and im thinking your dad was one of them animals out there. i dont expect my kids to be fighters; my kids never lived in a condemned building with their family. most of them are at ivy league schools their mothers are good mothers you know they do good stuff with them. i dont want my kids to be like me i dont want my daughter to date the guy like me. you know a guy like me success is to take care of my children to take care of their life and make em cushioned. i dont want them to be around a people like me. you know success for me would be that they never have the opportunity of being in the presence of someone like me.
