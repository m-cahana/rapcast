{"g-eazy": ["  notero: today were here with g-eazy shwoop breaking down his lyrics. his hardcore bars...  g-eazy: hardcore im so hardcore.  notero: so we wanted to know what your musical influences are because one of the most interesting things about you is that you do like this crazy rap and shit but then you also have yeah like stuff that sounds like its from decades and decades ago. so like what are your main musical influences  g-eazy: my main musical influences are the beatles. like right off the bat yeah. like my approach to making beats when i like write the music is the beatles and like a lot of like late 50s early 60s pop. so the beatles are first on the list. my second right behind the beatles as a really close second is... is the godly insane-ly talented dj carnage. dj carnage is like out of this world man hes really brilliant. um hes inspired my whole style my whole everything you know.  notero: wow thats incredible.  g-eazy: right behind john lennon you know. so hes up there man hes up there. uh johnny cash his storytelling and just you know i like to - with my lyrics i like to just frame stuff in a way that is relatable that people can connect with and identify with you know. um but uh yeah. other than that you know just uh lil b and um...  notero: lil b and the beatles that is all you need.  g-eazy: yup.  notero: so well some of those are kind of unconventional influences for rap. weve certainly heard beatles before but how do you make that work for hip-hop  g-eazy: it sounds unconventional on the surface but when you think about the music like beatles chord-progressions you know. the music isnt so different from whats popular today like like the same reason that those melodies and those chords sounded good back then is the same like fundamental reasons that they sound good over rap beats now you know its just taking melodies that people like to hear and telling stories about shit people can relate to and framing it in a contemporary way that fits like our world today. you know what im saying with drums that like you know hit hard and shit. that make it like viable in this world.  notero: thats awesome. so one other thing that i did want to talk to you about is that you are a producer and you told us that you produced everything except what the wonderful dj carnage produced.  g-eazy: what the wonderful dj carnage blessed me with.  notero: i dont know how you follow up that...  g-eazy: thats why i put it last on the album you know it had to be a bonus track it was too exclusive.  notero: otherwise he would totally kill you on your own...  g-eazy: id be so embarrassed to play my beats after anything dj carnage made. i worry about people that like play my album on repeat and they have to hear my tracks after hearing loaded. but yeah no i made every beat on my album um and i mean i started out really way more as a producer than as a rapper. um i started rapping just cause i was tired of you know waiting on like lazy rappers to come over who didnt have like the work ethic i did so i was just like fuck it. i can rap at least as good as you. you know and ill get better at it and ill get dope so its just like that was a decision i made like i dont know senior year of highschool or something like that. i just kept working at it and its just an obsession that took over my time.  notero: thats amazing you know like besides maybe hit-boy or kanye you always hear about it the other way you know like now the rapper wants to make his own beats.
