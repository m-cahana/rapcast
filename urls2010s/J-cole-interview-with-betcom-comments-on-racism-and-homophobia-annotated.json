{"j. cole": ["", "  bet.com: you got some backlash for anti-gay lyrics and you gave a statement to the huffington post. do you regret using the word f*****  j. cole: no not at all. its much different than the autism thing it wasnt conscious; that was a slip-up being offensive without intent. the line was to engage the conversation of homophobia in black culture and in hip hop. i thought it was going to be a way more interesting conversation that came from it. of course i made the statement but i thought from that it would spawn better conversations like why are we so homophobic much more than i think any other culture i dont want to just compare it to white people but in terms of jokes that you make \u2014 everythings got to be pause or no homo. you cant even play basketball without someone saying pause. im not innocent of it. i am part of that same culture \u2013 but why that line was supposed to be offensive and confusing but i was hoping to have more conversations about it.  bet.com: theres been a lot of conversation about the trayvon martin tragedy and what young black men experience. do you experience racism  j. cole: for sure absolutely i just got pulled over on 42nd street in times square for what i believe was nothing. they said it was for tints on my front window which is barely tinted. i really believe it was because i had my hat low. i was driving through times square and i just didnt want to be seen. so i had my hat low and i think i was looking suspicious just as a black man with my brim low when i was really just trying to cover my face. they came to my window pulled me over. i feel like if i was a white man driving they wouldnt question me about my tints. they told me to roll down my back window; they look in my car as if theyre looking for something. i feel like that was the real thing they were trying to catch somebody slipping. that just happened three days ago. i almost didnt even name that because i am so used to that. thats something that i feel like somebody my age thats white doesnt have to go through especially in new york city. on the other hand every time im on the plane in first class \u2014 this is a lesser evil but it still represents their mind state \u2014 i promise you 60 percent of the time somebody asks me what basketball team do i play for or do i rap.  i am a rapper i wish i could tell them something better \u2014 that happens all the time and i hate it. i hate that were stereotyped and i hate that im fitting into the same stereotype.  bet.com: youve talked about including dark-skinned women in your music videos versus all light-skinned women. the light-skinned dark-skinned issue certainly affects women in hip hop; does it affect men in hip hop  j. cole: i cant say it for sure but i just think were still in america. were still black americans. those mental chains are still in us. that brainwashing that tells us that light skin is better its subconsciously in us whether we know it or not\u2026 still pursuing light skin women. there are some women out there that are like i dont even like light skin men and thats fine. but barack obama would not be president if he were dark skin. you know what i mean thats just the truth. i might not be as successful as i am now if i was dark skin. im not saying that for sure im still as talented as i am and obama is still as smart as he is but its just a sad truth\u2026 i dont even know if this is going to translate well into text and people not hearing what im saying but its a sad reality. so i can only naturally assume its probably easier for a light skin male rapper than it might be for a dark skin male rapper. its all subconscious s*** nobodys aware \u2014 i think that s*** still subconsciously affects us.
