", " just through his music or personal relationship  ", " just through his music because i didnt meet him til the first time i met kanye was the first time i ever met him but i didnt really meet no cudi until like earlier like late late late last year when he came by the studio one time just to like talk to me  ", " what was it about cudis music that spoke to you so much  ", " i feel like he really dialed in on like the youth and really dialed in on like inspiration how to inspire you his words were very selected on like what to do i feel like he always made the soundtrack to my life or anybodys life who was like going through the same thing if you a big cudi fan you know exactly what im sayin like he says the exact same things you growing up with but makes it sound way cooler i went through this i went through that my mom didnt have this we had to go through this you know we had to go through christmas to do this but the beats and everything just sounded like you know the nutcracker  ", " do you think do you think and you were saying off the air too do you think he gets credit for being a cultural influence  ", " nah not at all cause i think you know cudi should be like a top tier artist up there man alongside with these other artists who like are number one you know i think he fathered a lot of a lot of the music a lot of style of music  ", " well we know what he did for kanye for sure like everybody talks about that  ", " hes a good influence and you know a good help his writing and his mind he makes beats i dont think people know that he made sky might fall you know he made mad beats he made some beats on 808s and heartbreak hes super dope he can write  ", " speaking of which who did the beats on this album on your record  ", " vinylz i always work with wondagurl on every album cant do a album without her tm this kid named dax murda cardo its weird though i only have 4 producers or something like that 4-5 producers  ", " you wrote with and worked with rihanna you wrote with and worked with kanye west on several things some other artists i dont want to run through the whole thing but what else are you doing besides writing your verses  ", " well when i first came into the game i made beats thats what i did i had to give people my own beats as a artist i lost a lot of lot of lot of time to make beats i wanted to focus on raps because i felt like when i came up here i wasnt the best rapper i had the best beats i was doing cruel summer i worked on yeezus with those albums like by the i got to jay z albums i was already having ill songs so it just turned into me just giving people my songs you know on ye album or her album so on i sat and worked with them on the whole album whether it was for two or three months picking mad beats whether its different people beats or taking out the drums putting my drums  ", " how do you know how to like craft something for someone else  ", " i always see it ima tell yall something about myself i was always making music  ", " you were mimicking other stash  ", " mimicking other artists when i was 13-14 years old making beats and making music just to get the sound right and so like i think every producer any young producer so like when they make like their favorite rapper made that beat make the same rap just to understand okay this how they did it  ", " to understand  ", " just to understand it completely okay the breakdown so when i grew up i was like you gotta translate it to your own songs so that kinda grew me up like welded me im a big fan of people man a lotta people feel themselves  ", " thats so important that you say that because not a lot of people come out and say yo im a true fan and i love  ", " who are you the biggest stan of youve worked with so far
