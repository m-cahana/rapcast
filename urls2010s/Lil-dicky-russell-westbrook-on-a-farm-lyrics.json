{"lil dicky": [" aint no doubt about it shit is coming and im just praying that lil dicky love it always told myself that this the type of shit i wanted i was being honest even made a promise not with anybody else this was inner conscious talking to my fucking self das a little bonkers i know i still got a lot of shit to conquer i hope that aint even my concern tho you know ill be working till i get what i deserve whatever totems i get personally you know ima earn those this aint even bout some shit up on a checklist this about the fact that im about to test this im about to figure out what my best is i cant avoid it because now ya boy invested and i aint gotta a choice except to smile and accept it pretty reckless pretty restless cuz ive lived my life expecting love to come the second my attempt was done and yea i guess to some extent i was correct because im getting buzz but now im bout to be ubiquitous look it up yeah or thats at least what im assuming but as alluded to reality is looming and now ya dude about to make a move and take the truth and hope to god that when he through that what he thought about is proven but honestly im not afraid that its delusion im hot enough to where i know its not illusion but obviously i been finding this confusing this aint even close to what i thought i would be doing dont get me wrong i was born to be big but i always figured it would be the comedy thing so i started rapping just to see what drama it brings what big dogs from sitcoms would holler at me and as the time past i rhymed faster lines crafted was high class as i mastered my craft and goddamn whoda thought it get like this back in twenty-ten music wouldnt make that list im talking top 5 to 10 strengths with no winks i would not lie my pen dry with no ink or\u2026 thats at least what i thought til i clawed and scratched the pen til i saw a line draw then i coulda let bygones be bygones but i really wanted to rhyme till my line drawn like where the fuck is my peak at not brown but i make it pop then i beat that not crowned yet but i dont think i decreed that not loud but you know im ready to tweet that i just really hope im ready to be that now you seeing where ds at cause even though im softer than a tissue i aint nothing to sneeze at im smarter where fuck ya degrees at and i aint harder but im hotter homie where da fuck ya degrees at im bout to come in and desaturate the chic rap today and evaporate the feedback i hate i elaborate at a later date but im getting off the point with the player hate what the fuck was i saying oh yeah im kind of a slave to my ambition i aint quittin till my shit is appraised and i admit it i predict that where i finish is crazy but that just means that its further away so\u2026burd about to work until he turn in his grave its really burdensome when earning somethings fun for the day but im concerned about da burning out from upping the stakes im always uppin the steaks im taking dinner meetings in new york always up for the steaks we exploring the discussion of great they assuring me that when im more elite ill be secure and amazed but this isnt insecurity mang\u2026 like this the opposite of that confidence in fact my biggest problem is i cant honestly relax because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts and i made a promise that i cant be the body thats stopping it think i need a lobotomy lil dicky the prophecy little bit of anomaly not a commodity not a fa\u00e7ade or a lotta da comedy prodigies commonly brought up wit dicky feelin weird lemme think of an analogy just imagine for a second what if russell westbrook never knew his own mentality grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality was people that conform to the ruralest localities to russell though it was nuffin but normality and he really nice up on the plow in actuality everybody liked the kid and dug his personality and so da mutuality was somewhat rationality so then ya man made a plan of practicality not even a plan it was more of a formality get a little land and attend to its vitality then raise a little fam til it all became finality the strategy was just to stay in the course and do ya chores when ya happy ya aint need to abort never explored nothing less he rollin round on his horse then one day he was up on his horse thats when he went past the porch the path he normally passes forth was fast and short was after more went faster north amassed a lure to master more and then discovered the court he like yaaa\u2026let me down tim hopped off lookin puzzled at the round rim saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then russell started dribbling and giggling astounded then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it and when he hit it russell listened to the fuckin sound friction up in a swish make and he was confounded because he knew that he had found him but right now it was still for the fun just a way to kill the time when the farming was done then the walking turned to running and the hoppin turned to jumping and dunking and russell had to keep coming because the youngn was fucking disgusting and loving it running it all of a sudden the public started to come in abundance and fuck wit him cause he was butter and hungry hung jury cause stories of glory not normally for people like him then the word got around up to espn and they flying russell down to compete in the gym bunch a grown men lookin to belittle the kid because to those men ball was the reason to live and the goats they been all in since they was kids so this goat owning mafucka look like a dick and even know russell knows that he doesnt submit he just chills with a grin and then the game start and this muthafucka take charge make it rain hard d up on these bitches making children of men lookin better than his predecessors ever could get turned the animosity to respect and then the thunder called him said they heard a lot about the ballin told him that they wanna get involved and showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league its so appalling oklahoma city in the autumn hella pretty awesome errbody laud him erry bitty lookin like they really fucking fallin condominium is so legitimate its sprawling and this muthafucka on the court straight ballin cash all up in that ass loling at the past like where the fuck would i be at up on the other path right if i never stumbled pon the game then think of that life shit who taking care of my farm who taking care of my farm who taking care of my farm i really loved that farm\u2026 uh  ", "", "   cake cake cake cake cake 500 million now
