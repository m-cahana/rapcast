{"earl sweatshirt": ["  you were just in toronto. how was that  it was crazy. canadians are weirdos though. they are so nice \u2014 overbearing nice like grandmother nice. toronto is like a city of grandmas.  the rapper drake is from toronto. is he grandma nice  dude drake is grandma nice. he was at frank oceans show in l.a. and got into an argument with tyler the creators mom. i left and came back in the room and she was apologizing to him for how she came at him and he was saying: its all love. i love you mom. i love moms. drake loves moms.  your mother is a law professor at u.c.l.a. does she ever pressure you to go to law school or anything  no. my moms down for what im doing now that she knows im not unraveling. when she sent me to samoa it wasnt like no rap music you know what i mean i didnt get thrown in the cellar for swearing.  rick ross was dropped from reebok because of a lyric about date rape on u.o.e.n.o. odd futures music often crosses similar lines.  rick ross if he was everything that he rapped about hed be the worst coke-dealing mass murderer ever. people got mad because he said something bad on a cool song. that was ridiculous on reeboks part. you picked up rick ross hes cocaine \u2014 thats what his entire career is.  ", "", "  the rap collective youre a member of odd future became famous very rapidly after you were sent by your mother to a school for troubled youth in samoa. did missing out on that success further your resolve to sort through the behavior issues that got you there  hell no. not initially and not the way that odd future was coming out \u2014 it was like a temper tantrum. it was perfect. but throwing a temper tantrum in a residential treatment facility is so much less cool than throwing a temper tantrum on tv.  while you were in samoa your whereabouts were pieced together by fans and bloggers. did it make you worry about how much information is available online  one day i hope to not have a twitter to be sick enough that i dont have to use the internet. but since we came up online i have to be online. twitter is a real addiction like the color of it the process of it.    your parents gave you the middle name neruda after pablo neruda. you can see why people are curious.  yeah it just happens to be that people like to associate poetry and rap music. i think that idea is kind of corny. i think rap music is rap music. i mean are there heavy writing aspects of it absolutely. in a sense is it poetry yeah. ive heard that so much growing up in a house with poetry. but i think people like to use that as a shortcut for whos good and whos not. its like the word lyrical \u2014 lyrical is the worst word in the entire world.  so its not a shocking concept that rap could be poetry.  its actually so familiar that its annoying.
