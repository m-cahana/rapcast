{"logic": ["  this song to me this was like the actual first song... i guess that you could say with structure you know like um just verse hook bridge. it was much more than just a beautiful intro and much more than just six minutes of raps like the previous record this was a full length song. this is you know okay we get it the kid can rap the kid can you know have fun but let me hear him create something and thats what i wanted to do on im gone. funny enough 6ix produced damn near the majority of the entire album himself and we were in the studio and we had just finished um i think it was uh the intro i think it was one of the last ones that we did actually and on the ride home he was like man i just want to get one more just one more and i was like hey if you can do it... and then the next day you know he made this beat and um and i wrote to it and for me this is my inspiration. me talking about my old inspiration. maybe just money and women and cars the cliche hip hop thing that i think a lot of people kind of get into hip hop for just fun stuff but kind of getting rid of that and going im going to tell my story finding the inspiration of wanting to just be myself and let the world know who i am and just make.... music. so it sounds as though im talking about a woman getting rid of my own woman and getting with my new woman - my new inspiration and leading into this album  "]}
