taking.  cut to raymond baxter type standing in front of map. a small cardboard cut-out of picassos face is on map and is moved around to illustrate route.  baxter: well picasso will be starting david

he meets the south circular at battersea here. well this is a truly remarkable occasion as it is the first time that a modern artist of such stature has taken the a272 and itll be very interesting to see how he copes with the heavy traffic round wisborough green. vicky.  cut to vicky holding a bicycle.  vicky: well picasso will be riding his viking super roadster with the drop handlebars and the

years winner of the derby-doncaster rally.  geppo is in full cyclists kit.  geppo: well reg i think pablo should be all right provided he doesnt attempt anything on the monumental scale of some of his earlier paintings like guernica or mademoiselles davignon or even his later war and peace murals for the temple of peace chapel at vallauris because with this strong head wind i dont think even doug timpson of manchester harriers could paint anything on that kind of scale.  reg moss: well thank you ron. well there still seems to be no sign of picasso so ill hand you back to the studio.  linkman: well weve just heard that picasso is approaching the tolworth roundabout on the a3 so come in sam trench at tolworth.  cut to sam trench at roadside.  trench: well something certainly is happening
