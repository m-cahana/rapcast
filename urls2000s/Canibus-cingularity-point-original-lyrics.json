normal limb configurations are dismembered and disconnected very unpleasant my third effort employs absurd ethics kangaroo execution court is in session after dawn but before breakfast expert effective mass burial method so well measured its impressive and intensive not to mention expensive extensive templates taken from all global nano-industrial sectors no wonder im so aggressive at tetris pardon me but i must beckon your attention for no more than several seconds with the minor hypocritical questions lets say i had to make an exception where i complied to exhume a body for postmortem autopsy inspection i request the best yes-men that promptly recovered the radio frequency identification pin then trigger the transponder located under the skin of the deceased until it showed me a grin if that went over your head then ill be more than pleased to show you again but i must rescind i have pressing matters to attend its my wifes birthday and i cant be late for delivery of her customized marble grey bidet good day what the fuck did he just say see why cant i bust my way since 98 you could trust my name ive adapted and adjusted my aim accordingly the leap years are

but all you can see is holographic artistry this is were the road forks my rhymes leave you lost under a blue moon ice crystals fog and snow fall been a long time spitting long rhymes but i never left you i always came back busting rhymes that were special back then i wanted to impress you by addressing the truth nowadays im just confessing in the booth the music is layered not computer generated a human made it to satisfy unusual craving the mystic in a room with crystal walls and floors looking into a crystal quartz orb reciting lyrical law that cause warm feeling sensations precipitating from the finger tips to the arms to the lips to the jaws to a gold tongue that spits to the tone of the drum with the oxygen that flows down the throat to the lungs til every color of my chakra glows brighter than the sun you and i become we we become one and the clarity of singularity has begun between zero point zero and zero point one combinatorics anything of this persuasion is considered ageless beyond the matrix beyond time displacement of space and spaceships in oasis beyond the reach of human contemplation through my music magic and convoluted interaction rip the jacker shows you the future in fragments through madness my view is expanded request passage permission is granted ill introduce you to the language of dragons to help balance near impossible trances in the labyrinth of the enchanted where air quality is unbearably rancid from evil spirits temperatures frigid i cross wooden bridges over methane rivers it sounds crazy but listen concise lyrics strike down from the heavens a titan like mike tyson beastmaster with a tiger and pigeon a four finger ring with a eyeball in it for vision cause i aint scared of no 9 foot 11 winged lizards im known as the ripper my soul was delivered to a wizard for spiritual slave labor in a prison my life is my sentence so i live it but i studied the physics and understand it so its only a visit i look at myself in the mirror i see a stereoisomer image i know its cryptic but you like what im spitting m-m-m-m-master in the art of rhyming yield so many surprises ive found excessive ferric-iron in my perinatal sinus remote viewing the globe what i am shown runs my blood cold my occipital lobe might explode the godzilla zillah god enscripter encryptor i drink the elixir of knowledge like it was a liquor i aint a rapper im a ripper slasher supreme dream catcher brother frater whod rather attend to other matters like mastering words spell cast a curse you havent heard incense i burn smells like a bag of herb i walk among the living hidden but spitting they bid me good riddance cause nobody knows what ive written zecharia sitchin in hells kitchen heavy lifting mixing vocals switching with no mittens my women keep bitching bitches drug experimenting bed wetting and blood letting white witches black magic rough wedding with a fuck ending i aint into fashion think i got jokes keep laughing well have the ceremony in a cabin rapping my only compassion that outlasted everything i ever had in life and it still respects the master during the brides reception the tree of life supplied me the weapons inside the zodiac divided in sections i categorized five elements inscribing the lettering baphomets unintelligible intelligence is benevolent the initiate magician not ready but willing to perform molecular fission with emotions and feelings i stand before the rabbi with cat-eyes he looked high i dont mind the motherfucker look crazy all the time he asked me for the wedding band i gave him the brides severed hand punishment for touching another man im just a poor shoe cobbler from guadalajara who came in contact with scholars that studied kabbalah i do not wish to be a martyr and follow the footsteps of my father i want to live the live of an honest farmer we all became sombre as i placed the animal on the altar started the fire rinsed my hands in some water look into my eyes i hypnotize my bride as i walk towards her the congregation wouldnt take their eyes off her i hear moans and weeping coupled with soft but laboured breathing i pinch myself am i dreaming invisible people speaking weve met but i dont remember meeting i dont remember these traditional teachings i know im reaching into unallowed boundaries but the rhymes are increasing my mind is breaching i find it pleasing inside the theatre of bar war unlimited seating the kills still fresh the cadavers still bleeding the war drum pounds like the wings of a owl beating right before it snares its prey and it begins feasting how nice of you to join me this evening to see the symphony for its surface complexity out of deep simplicity you see i achieve tranquility with obscure metaphors entering doors not placed between walls but in the floor midnight strolls through groves of roses sharing moments with whatever hostess is closest before the solstice approaches the fire burns but it burns smokeless ogres on flying locusts screaming buenos noches the final battle with vrill the war cries build run them over on the battlefield with chariot wheels my shield is composed of meteorite stone my sword is honed from a red dragons rib bones ripping and spitting basic complex combinatrix for the agents trying to hack into my matrix five out of ten cases are found with their heads hacked off in several places hanging from metal braces long ago the ghost of plato befriended me with a amulet intended to anchor my memories tabula smaragdina glow greener than any known reefer harness the ether talk to your leaders the seekers of beautiful bars recording the position of the stars undermining these immutable laws correlating dna crossed-fading whats the point in waiting were all aging its yours for the taking a black hole in the making nothing but a wound gaping from a womb where theres no escaping only life-forms racing before and after mating and merry-making with partners that arent even facing what are we chasing our ancestors asked the same thing and weve gotten no closer then theyve been so i prey for the day when we dont even need eyes to confirm the science and the poor education weve put our faith in i dont write this to perform it nor do i say it to record it i feel that i am answering a calling fantastic rhyme mechanics like that of a blind pianist the keys are metallic my fingers are magnets the music is magic what is this madness the stanzas are rites of passage your left brain habits become your baggage the masses become savage roaming the streets with torn fabrics creativity is less than average every baby is born a bastard so why did you have it this question requires no answer i understand it the c of tranquility that is all i seek nothing is complete without every separate piece the c of tranquility that is all i seek nothing is complete without every single piece  "], "canbius": ["", "   the c of tranquility what will it really be what does the future
