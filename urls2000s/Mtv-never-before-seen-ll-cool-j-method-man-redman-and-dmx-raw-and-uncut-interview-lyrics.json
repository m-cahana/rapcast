{"10:56": [". we can take it there but to make it fair get some more niggas. locks and myself will come with like four niggas. yall niggas best just stop playing because the "], "06:56": ["  interviewer:   so do you see it as an art form that right now a lot of mcs dont appreciate because there is a lot \u2013 now that you have the studio and you can just go in there and push a button and do your you know you can do your thing and you dont have to do it live \u2013 do you think that as an art form that is kind of lost right now  method man: yo man its like i dont like for somebody to come up and ask me to rhyme off the top in the street like that. i dont care for a camera in my face or if we are on the radio do you know what i mean if i came here to do one thing i am coming here to do one thing. so it is like when you know you are getting paid for this and this is a job you hold in all your stuff. it is like man i aint giving this out for free no more. so when they say freestyle they get funny at times like freestyle. there aint nothing for free. thats why you got paidstyle now you know what im saying  interviewer:   its paidstyle  method man: for real yeah its paidstyle. exactly. when its "], "07:51": [" the show is over and you is out and you in the parking lot \u2013 because usually it is the parking lot or the hotel that we are at or whatever and cats is there and they are starting it theyself but they open it up enough for you to step in and listen thats peace right there. because they aint asking you for nothing. if anything they give it. like check us out this is how we get down. and if you feel like you want to join in join in. i will be out there until sunup. perform for three hours and be out there until sunup  interviewer:   youre afraid that if you go on the radio or like right now if you were to freestyle for us you are afraid another mc is going to take that  method man: no its like i said man i aint just going freestyle off the top like that and just come at you on some yo this is "], "11:02": [" that you have forgotten about that will get you shot in your mouth. got my dogs covered plus its all gravy like chicken when its smothered. its dark and i love it. get him boy let em loose. you want it with a dog or the gun let him choose  interviewer:   all right thats a good one. so l now when you see whats happening today and what i was talking about is the luxury a lot of artists have of the studio. you could go in there and you could do your rhyme and you could say one line and do another and do it over and over again. do you think that a lot of artists in hip hop today have lost the art of just being able to come up with something off the top of their head and have it flow  ll cool j:  i dont think so. i dont even \u2013 honestly i dont even understand that question. i think that hip hop has only grown you know i mean the reality is when something evolves it changes shape and i think that people have expanded on upon what already existed and taken it to the next level and i think that is important. i dont think that any of the true art of hip hop has been lost because like i always say music \u2013 art imitates life. and rap music imitates life because its art. and the mirror doesnt change just the reflections in the mirror you know if ten different people stand in front of the same mirror the mirror didnt change but the reflection will change. so something that he is rhyming about and feeling now something that he is rhyming about and feeling now and something that melle mel was rhyming about or what run was rhyming about is going to be different. the art didnt change. it is still young urban men african-american men expressing what they feel growing up in an inner city environment. it is just that socially things have changed. you know reaganomics have come and gone different political policies have been implemented so it is going to reflect in what they talk about  interviewer:   let me ask you about the style regs style meths style dmx what you like. i just want to get a sense of why you picked them you put them on your record what is it that \u2013  ll cool j:  i feel like the beginning of one of those old kung-fu movies or something. redman he is known for dah dah dah. method man he is the \u2013 dmx. you know they all do their thing  interviewer:   but they do it different. that is what is interesting is they all do it differently  ll cool j:  they are different. they are different. you know red \u2013 his thing is like intergalactic and wild out and he talks about things \u2013 he says things that make you laugh and make you feel good. and he just paints an interesting picture do you know what i am saying he makes you feel like you know like his whole zone \u2013 you know what im saying its a place that you want to be. you know he makes you feel like it is a cool place to be like you want to sit in his car and listen to him because he is talking about a lot of things that people dont know. and he has a very cool flow the way he rhymes tracks that makes you want to dance. you know he can take the worst beat and just the way he sits on top of it makes you want to dance. and dmx the way he delivers things makes you feel like he is full of confidence in that you believe him so much that it makes it more interesting for you because you believe that he believes what he is saying and that is a good thing. do you know what i am saying and thats what i feel. and me i just do what i do  interviewer:   so what are we going to see that you are shooting here today  ll cool j:  what we are shooting today is a video that we are all involved in. it is called 43 2 1. it is a song on my album phenomenon. and there is an opportunity for everybody to just express themselves as artists and we came together and we are going to do some hip hop  interviewer:   what about the look on this  ll cool j:  the look  interviewer:   yeah because this reminds me of a lot of the older rap videos where everything was shot in new york city kind of in this vibe and now everything is color and you know \u2013 you know what im saying. you know hyped. so this kind of reminds \u2013  ll cool j:  this is more about what we are feeling as artists and just basic hip hop. it is very basic it is very simple. there is no glitter. a little ice but we will hide that  interviewer:   but you know what i am saying like how like now the videos everybody has got a hot -  ll cool j:  its evolved its evolved. and thats a good thing  interviewer:   yeah and thats good. but it is kind of a look  ll cool j:  it has evolved. i mean there used to be a time when all rock videos with guys with long hair doing this and breaking guitars. i mean it evolves. do you know what i am saying it is cool. i think that it is just an opportunity for us to do something basic. it reminds me of head bangers you know back in the days with those kind of videos. it is just one of those things  interviewer:   for "], "15:37": ["", "  genius and mtv have teamed up to bring you a new look into new york hip hop from 97 to 98. mtv has dug deep into their vaults and found three gems each never before seen in its entirety. as part of an ongoing project mtv is looking to the genius community to add context and personal stories to these interviews with some of the all time greats  here we have the second release in the collaboration between genius and mtv.  the interview takes you on the set of the 4321 video shoot featuring a cast of new york hip hop icons and captures several defining characteristics of new york hip hop in 97: lls longevity method mans prominence outside of wu-tang and dmxs rising stardom.  along with redman watch the four hip hop legends cut it loose during an otherwise tense time in the genres history  interview by abbie kearse _______________________________________________________  interviewer:   all right. well i am glad we have got everybody together. it took a little work it took a little work but we have got everybody together. what i want to talk about first is l i want to talk about getting this group together for your record. how did that come about  ll cool j:  well i felt like i had heard meth and red do a lot of records together and\u2013\u2013you gotta pardon me im a little hoarse\u2013\u2013i felt like they were\u2013\u2013the teamwork that they displayed in their records was uncanny and i felt like they sounded real good and i could add a lot to that chemistry  interviewer:   so you are talking about the record and the video for \u2013  ll cool j:  yeah like how high and the different songs that they made together. i felt like they were just powerful songs and it influenced me so much that i felt like i wanted to be a part of that because it felt so good to me. then my man d he is new and he is upcoming and he has got a lot of flavor. i feel like this would be a good opportunity to display some new people on the record as well. and i felt like all of us together including canibus could make something that was going to be powerful and something that would influence people. hopefully they might come back to hip hop and enjoy hip hop because this particular record the essence of it just the vocals and each individual displaying what they feel expressing themselves in an artistic matter. but at the same time us gelling together to create one work  interviewer:   i was going to say it definitely has more of an old school \u2013 are you all right  ll cool j:  im pretty all right. do your thing. you just do what you do  interviewer:   well because we can stop  ll cool j:  no im all right  interviewer:   i was going to say that the record has an old-school vibe to it in the fact that each mc has their different line and their break. so was that something you had in mind when putting the record together to go back  ll cool j:  yeah well the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 thing was something that was real important to me because i felt like we were taking it back. what do you guys think  method man: i wasnt listening  interviewer:   this is what happens. you get a group together and meth wasnt listening. well ll you tell him  ll cool j:  how do you feel about the old-school element of this with it being like four or five mcs coming together and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 hook just bringing all that together. how do you feel about that  method man: i feel like its only right to pay homage you know what im saying to the brothers that brought it in here. do you know what i mean so far it is to come out and come on living legend cool j you know what im saying like for us to even be here its like the epitome of rap right now. you know what im saying we are about to take it and blow it out the frame. that is why we have to count it down 4 3 2 1 is about to blow up out this piece. word up its great to be a part of it do you know what im saying  interviewer:   well i wanted to talk about \u2013 you were talking about ll as a legend. i mean you have been in the game for a long time and going back to those days of the records where it was really about the mc and almost the freestyle \u2013 so is this for you guys a freestyle type of record  ll cool j:  you know a lot of times when people talk about freestyle it is interesting because being a student of hip hop and growing up on hip hop i learned that freestyle back in the day really was when you write a rhyme and then you say it. what people call freestyle now is what people used to call off the top of the head. so it kills me when people say freestyle because it \u2013  dmx: its something else  ll cool j:  yeah its the wrong definition but it has taken on this ill kind of connotation. the reality is this was about guys putting forth what they write down and what they feel and expressing themselves as an artist. each individual occupying their own space and making the statement that they want to make. and that is part of what we do. i think the whole country is about that individuals being able to express themselves where they feel comfortable and say to the world what they feel comfortable saying. and displaying to the world what they are feeling emotionally  interviewer:   so you are saying in the old days freestyle was more about you had a rhyme that you were rehearsing in your room over and over again and that is what you came out \u2013  dmx: just talking mess thats all. you are not talking about any particular subject just talking about how good you are. that was freestyle to me. because there are many styles of rap you know what i am saying story rhymes you know what i am saying all types of styles. freestyle to me is a style not really speaking of any one particular subject just how nice you are  interviewer:   well i want to go down the line and get some opinions of your \u2013 or what are some of your favorite freestyle raps that you have either done yourself or that somebody else did that is just one of your favorites over the years so reg  redman: freestyle \u2013 like i mean i mean not to like \u2013 not too many artists that you can catch freestyle unless you cipher with them you know what i am saying i mean unless they do a little skit on the album or something like that. you have got to catch a freestyle artist at a party or something where he get the mic and air it out you know what i am saying i really vibe off brothers from the street like my piece that i am coming out with \u2013 i vibe off them freestyling on the mic. i am still taking the heat on the business level and the record industry level while they are still here taking the heat on the streets. so what they are freestyling about would be way different from somebody from the industry. so i really vibe off of up and coming artists really  interviewer:   do you have any favorite either that you learned what was your first rhyme that you learned or do you have a favorite  redman: i mean as far as freestyle sometimes you know freestyle is off the top of the head but sometimes people use it as a meaning of freestyle like the lyrics are straight up about anything. you could write a freestyle just straight up talking about anything or any subject any particular \u2013 you could jump from subject to subject. as a matter of fact the freestyle is what got me on you know what i am saying with bizmark epmd. you know what i am saying bizmark took me to monticello park in queens and i went down there and aired it out with a freestyle and people know me on the ground for freestyle rapping do you know what i am saying and when i did epmd it was the same way. so it gives freestyle a bit more respect than it is instead of just saying freestyle freestyle  interviewer:   its an art  redman: its an art its a technique yo  interviewer:   meth do you have a favorite what was the first freestyle you ever did whenever you got on the mic i dont know what was your first experience that you had to come up with something what did you rap about  method man: it was some old gilligans island rhyme or something like that you know what i am saying it had the theme to gilligans island in it. i dont really remember how it goes or whatever yet. it was one of my first joints but i had to come back strong after that. i remember they were throwing empty crack vials at niggas and all that shit. you know we was up at the club and it was bad up in the rec room party . it looks a little like that  ll cool j:  yeah you know what i am saying and thats cool i think thats a cool thing because it puts less emphasis on the set and the video and what it looks like and more emphasis on the artistry. you know what im saying i think that sometimes this is kind of like an unplugged if you will visually. cinematically you know what i am saying without all the glitz and glamour  interviewer:   and you get to put on your winter coat finally  ll cool j:  yeah i get to put on my winter coat  interviewer:   all right well just one quick question i have to ask about \u2013 i know this is odd i have to ask you about thanksgiving. what does it mean \u2013  ll cool j:  that was a non sequitur. im just playing go ahead  interviewer:   well i was asked to ask you about thanksgiving. what does thanksgiving mean to you  ll cool j:  to me for me thanksgiving is an opportunity to be with my family to share the meaning of love to share our spiritual relationship and a spiritual intimacy with my wife my children my grandmother my mother and all those \u2013 all of my loved ones. whether or not someone believes in a religious connotation of thanksgiving is another issue. what it means historically that is another issue. but relative to my family and me now it is just an opportunity for me to share love and to spiritually get closer break bread and be one. and unity you know with the family \u2013 that is very important first and foremost  interviewer:   that is a good answer. reg thanksgiving what does it mean to you  redman: thanksgiving \u2013 i mean it mean \u2013 what does that fall on the 25th right i mean it is like just eating some good food for a minute man. you know i mean you know artist that be on the road or you know we are doing our thing sticking with this hip hop thing it is a 24-hour \u2013  method man: you miss it a lot  redman: you know what i am saying it is a 24-hour-a-day job for us so you know it is usually the jamaican restaurant or something. or the corner store sometimes because we dont have time to really go catch a quick meal but you know that is one day. you know we can certainly cipher and chill out. and eat some good some good stuff  method man: thanks for giving. thanks for giving i dont celebrate though. i dont celebrate i dont celebrate thanks for giving  dmx: its just dinner man dinner. turkey stuffing all that type of shit. you know what i mean. aint a whole lot to that. there aint a whole to that its just food. food a lot of it everywhere  interviewer:   okay thats good. you know what they are doing something beavis and butthead and kurt loder are going to be covering the parade  ll cool j:  yo man you said jamaican food because you are on tour dog  redman: no just \u2013  ll cool j:  i am feeling you fam. im feeling you. oh my god  interviewer:   thank you  ll cool j:  thanks for giving yo. 4 3 2 1 coming to a theater near you  "], "08:30": [" or whatever like that  ll cool j:  i think the analogy that is he is making is simply that as good as michael jordan is at basketball the reality is he wouldnt stop at a playground and go in there and risk start dunking around and doing his thing soaring over cracks in the asphalt to dunk glory you know at the playground. there are just certain levels to it. i think that freestyle is very important because it keeps you on your ps and qs and it makes sure that you are sharp in terms of the way you articulate what you are feeling. but you know the reality is i think you have to constantly grow and there has to be growth there. you know  interviewer:   oh wait is everything okay is it all right  method man: no we were just saying how news is like north east west and south. you know what i am saying its all news. north east west and south  ll cool j:  thats where it comes from probably  interviewer:   so dmx i know that you are relatively new at least to us  dmx: to the label but not to the game though. not to the game  interviewer:   so how long have you been in it  dmx: i have been on the floor for like 13 14 years. you know what i am saying i am only 26 so i just was doing it you know what i am saying and not even thinking about getting on just doing it because i love doing it. do you know what i am saying i like doing it i like getting the response do you know what i mean from my people  interviewer:   so what about yourself do you have any favorite like was there a certain \u2013 who to you do you feel was the best at the art of freestyling i know you have got ll standing here but you can honest  dmx: thats a tough one. the best \u2013 i mean i would have to say me. i mean not \u2013 i would have to say that on the "], "10:08": [" you know what im saying but that i write what i like to hear you know what im saying and niggas been doing it for a mad long time and there is much respect in all that you know what im saying so you cant take nothing from nobody. but do you know what im saying but im sure every one of us here feel the same way were the best. i am i mean they all say that they are because you have to feel like that  interviewer:   well i know that meth you were saying that you want to get paidstyle you want to get paid. but would you do something to give us a little example because \u2013  dmx: you mean would i do it now  interviewer:   yeah just a little something. i could do the human beat box  dmx: i mean i got the curses. do you know a lot of our stuff  interviewer:   thats all right too  dmx: all right well if you want it like that \u2013 check it. im headed nowhere fast running in place gun at my waist niggas wanted a taste but wouldnt come at my face. so what that mean you catch us playing games again so now what do i do start naming names again. all you player haters know that i speak from the heart. you play like you dont know how "]}
