{"dmx": ["", "   let us pray lord jesus it is you who wakes me up every day and i am forever grateful for your love.. .. this is why i pray you let me touch so many people and its all for the good i influenced so many children i never thought that i would and i couldnt take credit for the love they get because it all comes from you lord; im just the one thats givin it and when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much i take time out and pray and ask that you be my crutch lord i am not perfect by a longshot -- i confess to you daily but i work harder everyday and i hope that you hear me in my heart i mean well but if youll help me to grow then what i have in my heart will begin to show and when i get goin im not lookin back for nothin cause i will know where im headed cause im so tired of the sufferin i stand before you a weakened version of your reflection beggin for direction for my soul needs resurrection i dont deserve what youve given me but you never took it from me because i am grateful and i use it and i do not worship money if what you want from me is to bring your children to you my regret is only having one life to do it instead of two amen  "]}
