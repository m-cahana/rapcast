{"lupe fiasco": ["  dear white supremacy  first of all you are not really that supreme. while throughout history white supremacy it must be admitted you have achieved some very dominant positions. these positions have been gained mostly through force or some biological agent such as disease that did a lot of the dirty work for you in advance. i mean and anybody can use force on an unarmed populous and anybody can have smallpox. not judging just wanted to point out that having a disease that native folks arent immune to because theyve never seen it doesnt make you strategically smart or tactically superior just kind of sick. and these dominant positions dont really stand up to the test of time that long either. there is nothing about you biologically or physically that denotes an innate mode of supremacy. for that matter there is also nothing about you psychologically philosophically cognitively academically socially architecturally culturally or even financially that signifies a higher position above any other group. and to be diplomatic there is nothing about you that denotes innate inferiority as well. so what you really are is something in the middle. you are regular. white regularity is congruent to all other forms of regularity i.e. black brown etc etc. but in regularity there is room for differences and this is where white regularity shines each group gets the same essential universals. dance food music etc. and it must be admitted that the white regularity take on these universal institutions has been unbelievably impressive and a great addition to the total world culture. i mean spaghetti and meatballs romeo & juliet coldplay the tuxedo lighter than air travel are all world class additions to the collective bucket but they are no less or more impressive than every other regular groups take on the universals either. and if we really wanted to get analytical every invention is built on inspiration from a previously existing invention so the claim of the supreme 1st to do something is highly debatable and except for a few exceptions impossible all things human arent born from a supreme overlord solely working in isolation. things are created in collaboration and in tandem with other cultures knowledge structures and movements and more important people. i mean if those muslims didnt catalog all that greek philosophy for research we might not even know who plato was. now whether this collaboration is forced which is seen so much but not exclusively throughout human history does not take away the fact that it is done with the help of somebody else. we are supreme as a spectrum of colors in collaboration. one color does not dominate the other nor can it. sure steve jobs was white. but the guy who built the computer was probably chinese. and the girl who wrote the programs for the computer is probably from mumbai. and the raw materials that were used to make it where probably first pulled out of the ground by somebody in south africa. and if you take this highly collaborated upon piece of high technology to an indigenous tribe in the jungles of brazil theyd probably use it as a boat paddle. and we can go on and on down or up the rabbit hole all day long and youll always find a regular somebody relying on the abilities of a just as regular somebody else that another regular somebody doesnt even care about. white supremacy is a lie white regularists tell to themselves in hopes that they can get a one way ticket to the top and hope we other colors overhear it. heres the bad news aint no top. heres the good news though aint no bottom neither its just the regular ole middle where nobody is safe from being influenced by somebody elses extreme regularness. is your swastika flag printed in mexico did you know the swastika is officially from asia and the subcontinent did you know black people had slaves in africa too did you know in the world your considered a minority too i mean you call us niggers and beaners but you gotta ship all your former native american land backwood sourced ginseng to china to get money to support your meth habit. meth thats made with chemicals produced in india. i mean hitler hated everything about the jews expect every possession they had. its funny how the things you hate so much you have to rely on the most for your survival. and if you wanted to get really ironic and meta about it white supremacy has to validate its on identity based solely on its relationship to other races i mean now thats what i would call joined at the hip. without us there is no white supremacy because there would be nothing to supreme over that sounds so stupid but sometimes the truth is stupid. stupid like a fox. and no not stupid like a fox news i mean the real fox. the animal. in closing white regularity the race formerly know as white supremacy i myself on behalf of my own black regularity salute you. good luck with the northwest front i hear its beautiful in the spring and probably a strategic death trap if and when yellowstone finally decides to blow up yours truly  wasalu lupe jaco   "]}
