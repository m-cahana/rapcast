in new york city. two hes not entirely happy with his distributor. and three soldado nation and ruiz are too low-rent for lobos. theyre not organized enough to distribute his product. and he was not shy in telling mr. ruiz he did not give a fuck  angela [laughter] we have permission from the mexican government to detain and prosecute mr. lobos if we can build a compelling case against him.  frankie we cant touch him unless we know we can put him in jail.  angela who can give us the names places and dates we need to convict lobos his new york distributor. unfortunately we have no idea who that is. we do have a profile of the type of criminal were looking for. hes a highly organized individual with an established network in place. he already knows how to move money through the system is violent enough to control his territory but still has something to lose something lobos can threaten to keep him in line. so why is lobos looking to replace him what couldve gone wrong there must be some element out of his control. [pink sneakers attempts to kill one of the carriers] whatever the reason this problem between lobos and his local guy is exactly what we need to exploit because the man were looking for is in grave danger from lobos and from us. we can give him a way out but only if he decides to take it.  james [cell phone vibrates] tommy whats up im on my way.
