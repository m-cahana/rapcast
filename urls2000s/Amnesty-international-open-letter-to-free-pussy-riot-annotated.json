{"mos def": ["  dear masha and nadia  as the one-year anniversary of your trial approaches we are writing to assure you that around the world people are both still thinking of you and working for your release. although you were the most visible of the protesters we know that there were many other young people who have suffered in the protests about whom we are also very concerned. but in many ways through your imprisonment you have come to represent them.  many artists voiced their concern when these charges were first brought against you we had every hope that the authorities in dealing with you would show some understanding a sense of proportion even some of the wonderful russian sense of humour but none of the above were forthcoming.  the impact of your shockingly unjust trial and imprisonment has spread far and wide. especially among your fellow artists musicians and citizens around the world including the many parents who feel your anguish at being separated from your children. while understanding the sensitivities of protesting in a place of worship we ask that the russian authorities review these harsh sentences so that you may return to your children your families and your lives.  the right to freedom of expression and dissent is a legitimate one and essential in any kind of democracy. you have been accused of what could be described as a victimless crime but in our opinion in a just society there can be no crime where there is no identifiable victim.  your strength bravery and fearlessness are an inspiration to us all.  yours in solidarity  bryan adams adele alt-j laurie anderson animal collective anti-flag arcade fire arch enemy archive joan armatrading joan baez beardyman jeff beck yasiin bey bj\u00f6rk rub\u00e9n blades billy bragg jackson browne peter buck tracy chapman chase & status neneh cherry the clash coldplay lily rose cooper dido django django melissa etheridge siobhan fahey paloma faith first aid kit franz ferdinand foster the people fun. peter gabriel sir bob geldof kim gordon debbie harry pj harvey don henley the hidden cameras niall horan billy joel sir elton john ke$ha angelique kidjo the knife mark knopfler tom lehrer sean lennon annie lennox lykke li sir paul mccartney romy madley-croft madonna zayn malik stephen malkmus marina & the diamonds johnny marr massive attack mike mills moby thurston moore tom morello alanis morissette james morrison graham nash kate nash youssou ndour karen o yoko ono clock opera ozzy osbourne liam payne peaches joe perry phoenix portishead portugal. the man rain phoenix cat power radiohead bonnie raitt rise against patti scialfa scissor sisters paul simon sleigh bells patti smith esperanza spalding bruce springsteen dave stewart sting michael stipe harry styles neil tennant louis tomlinson pete townshend k t tunstall u2 eddie vedder.
