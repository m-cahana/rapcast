like joe torre i reintroduced myself to the world: im jerz im an artist i paint pictures i dont rhyme words more than a rapper i pay attention to detail but how i do in retail tells me if i prevail leonardo aint seen these trials and tribulations foul situations with some mild stipulations i feel like being an addict is a curse its somethin bout dude that makes bad shit worse theres three types of niggas in this world you know so you either gon make shit happen or watch shit happen or or not know what happened so i couldnt just sit there like fuck rappin its dudes with problems i couldnt
