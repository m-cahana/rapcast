{"canibus": ["", "   you know this rap game is a lot like high school and high school is a lot like life you see in life you got to do things to set yourself apart from your peers you need to identify the qualities that separate you from those around you after all isnt that what most people spend they lives trying to accomplish wouldnt we all want somebody somewhere later on down the line to remember the things that were different about us dont you understand the more you fit in the less youre noticed thats how it is for anyone to walk through life unnoticed as if they never mattered could be a punishment worse than death and at the same time that punishment is the only way you could truly be free; free from the things you want people to remember about you but also free from the things you want them to forget i dont know if that freedom exists for me anymore and even though i dream about what it would be like its just a dream because i realize now more than ever that i cant have my cake and eat it too no one can and as time goes on we will always be loved by some and hated by others and whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not they really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name you see anytime anybody ever talks about you either directly or indirectly they put a quarter in your immortal meter they keep you alive whether they want to or not they practically do the opposite of what they want to do which is forget you. i dedicate this song to the day when you motherfuckers finally figure it out and the day that you bury me and erase the memory of me here lies a man who became forgotten to the world in his search to the key for immortality he never made an impact he changed nothing and his words meant nothing he never contributed to the rap game; he never gave you anything to talk about he never existed and he never made a difference his name was nobody  "]}
