{"kanye west": ["  id like to thank everybody who came out tonight to rock with me. you could have been anywhere in the world. you could have been anywhere in the world...  this is the part of the show where i start complaining about shit justifying shit but you know how it is. im just happy to be making music and happy to be able to perform this shit for you all. you know with this album we didnt drop no single for radio; we aint have no big nba campaign or nothing like that we aint even got no cover. we just made some real music  back when i used to make albums and shit like a couple years ago 3 years ago like 4 years ago wed go away and work on an album for like 5 months or something wed always have to hold the album til like august or september for the perfect moment or some shit. because it means that youre probably gonna sell more get more audience and radio and shit  but honestly at this point when i listen to radio that aint where i wanna be no more. and honestly at this point i could give a fuck about selling a million records as long as i can put out an album this summer that you guys can rock to all motherfucking summer. yall dont tell me im gonna sell more records. because at this point i dont really give a fuck about outside opinions. all i give a fuck about is my clique-clique-clique....
