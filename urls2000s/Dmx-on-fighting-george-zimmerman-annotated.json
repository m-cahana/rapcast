"], "is this justice you feel was denied": ["  its not really about that for me because again the trayvon martin story was sad enough. justice needs to be served for his mother and his father and his family. i just think that how zimmerman is playing it and being a media whore and looking for all this attention that he shouldnt be getting...if theres a chance to box him then i want in.
