depth like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet im already covered in sweat and i wasnt even ready to come in yet ahh let me set this drink down beat up a gal start beef with her pal probably be wild til im wrinkled and senile and rap god was a freestyle off the top of the dome piece while i was sleep on the couch and im freestyling now i need a towel sweat leaks from my brow its burning my eyes my cerebral is foul cause shit im thinking about should be illegal i need my head banned like the guy who left cleveland ohio and went to south beach with his talents scream fuck you on the way out and wink with a smile this whole game can eat a dick im going back deep underground but right now im back on that bullshit and you im singling out cause youre so fucking outdated you should mingle a while what the fuck is this klusterfuk of busters bunch of buster douglas motherfuckers is one hit wonders one swing and youre crowned knocked one out the park one catchy jingle and now you think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou bitch i can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground reach up swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd and heave a child in a sink hole on cinco de mayo when im sprinkled in pico de gallo mardi gras beads in a towel i just made that up i dont know much spanish im not bilingual but ill show you a mexican stand off between just these two amigos cause neither really wants to say what were thinking out loud but i sure as fuck think i know how read body english no doubt cause were trying to kill each other but lyrically the fuck is humility what is a real emcee royce he came up in the shit with me never spit that hustler shit it wasnt a fit for me let them adjust til they just get the gist of me just not giving a fuck and plus with the history of muscular distrophy it wasnt a mystery why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning so what in the fuck is a list to me im used to not being on it i expect it out em heck wit em i get my respect without em aint really been into diamonds since i put my first record out but i could put a chain around my second album and wear it as a neck medallion became a millionaire went downhill from there became civil office swivel chair sterling silverware screaming life is still unfair til i get a real career the fuck am i gonna do until then this job is too fulfilling two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in and a mood to kill till i plow my coupe de ville into some children at the food pavilion and build-a-bear warriors mind im pro-hydrocodone euphoria in the drug emporium line im soaring im pouring vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on em fore i go four wheeler riding gory and violent and horrifying you surely wont find no one more abhorring than i am with this retaliatory of rhyming for gloria steinem but i finger her like a witness show me a line-up i usually am abusive but excuse me maam i guess i mustve threw you for a loop like toucan sam when i said i could use the sample cause yous a tramp but look how you react to this trigger like when i call you a bigger dyke than the hoover dam youre playing right into lex luthors hand its such a ruthless plan might even lose a fan but fuck it superman wouldnt change in a phone booth for stan im a brand new being like grand pubas band happy as anderson cooper having a tuba crammed in his pooper with lubricant...wait thats too... i cant since honesty is the best policy ill give you the old college try try to acknowledge my mistakes probably wont qualify as a gentleman and a scholar but its time that i swallow pride and say that im sorry sorry i cant apologize i think of all them times i compromised my bottom lines and thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughters minds then im like dollar signs but i may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke is more of a knockout than janay rice play nice bitch ill punch lana del rey right in the face twice like ray rice in broad daylight in plain sight of the elevator surveillance til her head is banged on the railing then celebrate with the ravens never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants id meditate but i may need a better way to escape the aggression rage and the anger cause leg restraints on the ankles heavy weights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains just aint enough to contain it but i still get the same respect as jay if i came on stage in a fucking neglig\u00e9e everyday and liz claiborne devastated from breakup with kate hudson wait slut your friends what are they gonna say cause makeup aint gonna cover that eye thats seven-eighths of the way shut peppersprayed with your face cut made my bank like a lay up off these
