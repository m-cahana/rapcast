{"joe budden": ["  my path for tomorrow is relaxing at full throttle born to be a leader but a tough act to follow bet on me at all costs in spite of my cash so if i cant afford the waldorf i can afford to fall off stories over greatness no stopping my zone im bumping romans revenge but im plotting my own like a prophecy in case niggas havent learned not to bother me before you send your shots just check my return policy could do without the leeches shoes without the creases miami heat hater but i do the south beaches for any drama i be calling up monsters i aint gilbert i never met a wall i cant conquer ruger aimed if im who you try and belittle i learned its hard to get justice when you try and be civil whatever the future holds i can live with the day some niggas will sell their soul but some will give it away and thats the devil in disguise they window of opportunity is minimized simplified check what i exemplify bitch nigga heres something for you to generalize estate out by tenafly pool houses winterized play in that water you bound to get your feet wet only rapper with nothing to hide me and g-dep my shorty might disagree with that sentiment if i keep something from you i promise its all innocent bitches gon get you with that fake out beat wont let them media takeout me a made nigga gotta know im dealing with me gotta put up with a lot of hate before you say you love me how much of it can you tolerate you cant talk about marriage and giving birth if you hit the dirt anytime you think i lift a skirt it grows tiresome every time you get berserk plus if you abandon home over what was just a flirt without a care ill just chuck deuces my skin will turn numb and youll be stuck with what your truth is then youll feel a way thinking i should have resisted then youll start to see a side of me you never knew existed cause youve never seen me act like a jerk i know women will provoke you and get mad when it works rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst cause i go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait its to the point i gotta ask myself why the fuck is it so easy to detach myself maybe it aint you just something i lack myself but if these wounds are self inflicted i can patch myself now listen i could give a fuck bout how them other niggas treated you if your ass was that perfect they would be with you i dont care if you dimed out youll say your the best ill ever have and ill say im willing to find out wait im thinking bout our bond and what happened to it if you aint lifting the burden you probably adding to it she say my logics wild and its sick to her she say im all for self and dont consider her she feel like she dont have a voice in this relationship im thinking boo you got a choice so why you taking it certain shit i wouldnt stand for im giving her my all but she demands more i wish she would understand more certain shit you couldnt plan for im guessing if i love you and youre worth it i should take some time out and figure if you deserve this but you just think that im full of it we both come from backgrounds of bullshit im fortunate that aint what you see in me ill stop lying to you once you start believing me but im always who you wanna bring the questions to its less about me hiding shit and more about protecting you its totally different the way our minds are made up to me flirtings natural to her its cause for break up to me its human nature she disagree with the logic confusing being monogamous with being robotic i talk to other girls i interact with em you shouldnt take that as tryna get in the sack with them just know how i act with you is how i act alone i signed up for a girl not a chaperon besides that planll backfire and ill dishonor her she dont take my word and now i feel im being monitored and i want you to be the one that i endured the longest accept me at my weakest support me at my strongest bring something to the table though earn ya keep then ill triple it and all i ask in return is peace aint with the arguing shit all the time you see im honest to a fault but is it yours or mine i put you through some things where you could have bolted you want honesty or rather shit be sugar coated ill put you on a list of people screaming fuck me too do you want a pretty lie or the ugly truth truth is you got some things that you gotta learn too when everything that concerns me dont concern you truth is you gotta a couple tainted views and you bring up my ex as if i couldnt do the same with you truth is you want me the dude that kept it realer truth is youre too emotional and need a better filter no third party will ruin our plan id hate for you to be the girl whos too consumed with her man so i want you to have your own plans you to have you own ends you to have your own life you to have your own friends and ill be right beside you i can tell that you pride full cause you dont bring up problems that you got with me till i do you say that im out a lot and that i aint here enough you take care of me and ill take care of us id love to put a child in you and live lavish but my baby momma scared me let me tell you bout my baggage we could have a son and break up and be done and now ill never see him again as you take him and run you gon tell him that hes fatherless tell him that im cowardly youll have some resentment so youll start acting childishly youll rape me in court cause of course youll have it out for me to you it may sound absurd but for me its a reality still at times where it seems like youre not proud of me though im showing you the best man i know how to be but you keep saying show me more youd appreciate me better had you known me before youve never been cheated on had another chick in your house in your bed you you aint seen the worst time hit you with that old move take you to a flick that ive already seen with another broad but pretend like its my first time and nah you dont know how that sound on the
