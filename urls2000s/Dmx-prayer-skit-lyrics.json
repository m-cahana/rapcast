{"dmx": ["  lord jesus you have brought me from a place so dark to the point where i can now feel the love in my heart and i know its just a start for there is more to come so now i embrace it when i used to run didnt know what i was running from or running towards until one day i saw it; i was running from the lord and when i came back you accepted me with open arms and said all is forgiven. and i became so strong that i could fight off the devil with just spoken words say it devil i rebuke you and i saw that i was heard because no matter what ive been through i can deal with it and because of what i went through i was still fitted with the armor that comes with the blood of jesus knowing even when we are suffering he sees us or when youre lost he will lead the flock to find the one just like any father trying to find his son and let me remind you no matter where you at he will find you and help you put the negative behind you lord give me a sign please let me know youre here or at least let me know youre near remind me to call you when we need you remind me to call you because we all need to and give us the strength to just make it through just one more day in jesuss mighty name we pray amen  "]}
