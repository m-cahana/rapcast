{"bun b": [" i dont care if youre old young fat skinny pop no pop underground top ground. is your rhyme dope if it aint it dont mean shit. thats the bottom line.  ", " in hip-hop someone has got to set the standard. the decision to form the group prhyme was something that happened organically. after years of collaborating with each other dj premier and royce da 59 decided that they could only fulfill their artistic destiny by joining forces for a full-length project. it was a step they both needed to take for hip-hops sake.  ", " yeah. im not really into like everybody seeing how i do my beats. but you know as far as the whole aspect of how i program for artists that work with me i let them see it. i dont let them ever film it but its more like hey take the memory of what you saw.  ", " with dj premier royce da 59 was in his comfort zone and the chemistry between the two of them is undeniable. but on their first project as a duo royce wanted to do things a little differently. thats where their music of adrian younge comes from.  ", " prhyme started as an idea. it was a idea that was meant for slaughterhouse by the group. its this new kid. hes hot. everybodys sampling his music. he gets with his band. and one of his goals in his career was to make it where everybody in hip-hop is sampling him. you know they make all of their music from scratch. he scored the whole black dynamite movie. he did the soundtrack to it. his name is adrian younge.  ", " though premier had been vocal about staying in his own lane the addition of adrian younge allowed the producer to experiment with the unique sound of a new generation. adrians music presented preem with a challenge that he was resistant to at first.  ", " it looked different for me because i didnt really want to sample one artist. and then with adrian younges music - the catalog that he gave me to use - i was just like how am i gonna make it sound like we sound different with every song when its just one artist but you know with adrians style and sound i wasnt doubtful i just didnt know how far i could pull off being different because miles davis never sounded the same on every record.  ", " honestly its crazy because these new versions that you made actually make my music better. cause when i listen to my music now i think of prhyme. i mean its hard for me just to think of my music on its own. you made that stuff better.  ", " musically the production on prhyme exceeds expectation. the beats represent hip-hop in its rawest form giving royce more of a reason to continue to keep the lyrical content ahead of the curve. and even inspiring a few up-and-coming beat makers including  royces own sixteen-year-old son in the process.  ", " yeah i remember. cause i was always showing - i was always like aye let me play you this real quick. and id play it for him in the car and stuff. hed be like yeah this is good. you know i like it. but i always kind of wanted him to be like wow. wow. like vibing and shit. you know what im saying  so i remember i was playing - when i was first making music i had the drum going with the sample. he was like i like that. i like that. and he went back. i was so happy. cause that was the first time - i aint even had to ask him to listen to it. he just automatically caught on. that was the very first time.  ", "", "   its that element of complexity that will make prhyme stand out.  "]}
