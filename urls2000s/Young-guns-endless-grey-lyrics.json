{"young gunz": ["  shadow i cast well it weighs more than my soul* and its the only proof that i am here at all i will comfortably invite you if you promise to accept under no uncertain terms youd be second best  so unwind this mortal coil with me cause your darkness is a light to me  all of my colour is bleeding away so now you watch me fade into the endless grey into the endless grey  i keep the inevitable at arms length pushing back with all my strength but its not enough  while my heart collapses like old clay heed my warning stay away  all of my colour is bleeding away so now you watch me fade into the endless grey into the endless grey  all of my colour is bleeding away so now you watch me fade into the endless grey all of my colour is bleeding away so now i walk alone into the endless grey into the endless grey  "]}
