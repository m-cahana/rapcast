my type of guy she said her name was crystal and she kept the pistol on her and if i ever cheated believe i be a goner so i played the perfect gentleman ever time i was wit her and when i wasnt wit her i was going to get her when i wasnt going to get her she was coming to get me then when she wasnt coming to get me she was wit me so for a while everything was smooth i waited and contemplated my next move my instinct had told that the time was right for us to get together for a magical night so i called her she said hello i said hey she said wait i already know what you have to say she said baby i know youre wondering why i wont go over to your place because im not too sure about how you feel so id rather go at my own pace oh i dont know the way that i feel im so afraid of a one night

you come on and go with me come on over to my place. where we can sit down and talk about it face to face why dont you come on and go with me come on over to my place where we can discuss the  of picking up the pace she said i thought about it and i think that your right but my parents are home so it wont be tonight but um why dont you come over tomorrow at 8 my parents leave at 7:30 and wont be back until late. i said then let me go and get set tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget so the next day around 7:54 i picked up like 6 condoms and headed for the door stepped outside i was asked where was i going by detectives with nine millimetres that were showing i said to my girls house. they said no you arent i said why not they said because they have a warrant i said thats impossible how can that be they said its right here robbery first degree. well anyway to make a long story short i ended up in  going to court so i call crystal the night around 8 i said its just a mix up and blamed it on fate she told me that she loved me and promised to wait she said ill see you in court on your next court date. despite being locked up things werent bad i still had my girl and for that i was glad she always came to visit didnt mind the  and every night i wrote a letter telling her things like  {bridge} i cant feel myself i dont want nobody else to ever love me you are my shining star my guiding light my love  theres not a minute hour day or night that i dont love you youre at the top of my lips cause im always thinking of you i still remember in the days when i was scared to touch you how i spent my daydreaming learning how to say i love you you mustve known that i had feelings deep enough to swim in thats when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in oh mama a thousand kisses from you is never too much and i just dont wanna stop  {verse 2} days turned into weeks weeks into months 10 days to 25th and ive only gotten mail once what had happened to my love life why do i feel like ive been stabbed in the back with a knife i tried to believe i said she loves me she does but deep down i knew what the scoop really was you see jody had my girl and now she was gone just thinking about it had me singing every love song im thinking to my self how could she do me wrong but its not her fault i was away for too long i thought i had a girlfriend but now i know better she told me that she wrote me but i never got the letter every time i tried to call her nobody was home and since i had to call collect she put a block on the phone she told me she would visit but damn i havent seen her you wanna know why because jody is in between her legs and getting busy he even ate the coochie yo i bought her everything from fendi to gucci but  in something that i didnt even have to sweat her and if it doesnt happen by now its gonna get her um  {bridge} thrown up in the middle i dont know what to do what do you do when your girl is untrue theres another man another man in my life in my life ohh another man is beating my time another man is loving mine ohh another man is beating my time another man is loving mine  {verse 3} beating my time another man was loving mine i was upset but there were other things on my mind i would start trial soon and was facing a lot of time and on the day of trial i was nervous for a while but when they said not guilty i stepped with a smile back to freedom freedom on the streets again where i had to go and see what was up with my friend so i called her just to make sure she was home i said hello and a mans voice answered the phone i was confused at first i didnt know what to do said who is this he said its jody and what is it to you i turned up the receiver picked up my gun and straight for crystals crib i started running murder murder my fingers on the trigger murder murder ima murder this nigga. so then i thought why should i do him he wouldnt have no pussy if she didnt give it to him i thought about killing him thought about it twice said nah. why because it wouldnt be nice and for the sake of curiosity i had to go see crystal and ask her why did it have to be me i knocked on the door and just like before i heard a mans voice saying he couldnt take it any more the door opened up but jody  he looked me up and down and said i guess  now here comes crystal yelling and fussing hollering screaming shouting and cussing she looked at me and  got quiet in the hall she  and why didnt you call i turned around to leave and she said please dont go i said you used to be my girl now youre nothing but a ho i understand cause im a man but theres no  in stake so i spread my wings and fly away yeah  {outro} you know what im sayin dmxs  for 91 pushing up no daisies cause im real  "]}
