{"eminem": [" came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin but dont think i ever stopped to think that i was speaking to children everything was happening so fast it was like i blinked\u2014sold three million then it all went blank all i remember is feelin ridiculous cause i was getting sick of this feelin like i am always under attack man i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin women dishin but really thinking: if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him. guess im a little bit of a hypocrite when im rippin shit but since when did this many people ever give a shit what i had to say its just my opinion if it contradicts how im livin put a dick in your rear end thats why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawing more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform im flattered you thought i was that important but you cant ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed atta-boy they told me to slow down and i just zoned out good luck tryin to convince a blonde its like telling gwen stefani that she sold out cause i was tryin to leave no doubt in anyones mind one day id go down in history think they know now because everybody knows  ", " thanks for the support asshole *scratch* thanks for the support asshole  ", " quit actin salty i was countin on you to count me out ask asher roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out thought i was history but goddamn honky that compliments like backhanding a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth nah im off him but what the fuck is all this trash-talkin about the fight was fixed im back and you cant stop me you knocked me down i went down for the count i fell but the fans caught me and now youre gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me to take my belt\u2014word to pacquiao momma said there aint nothin else to talk about

stinks you think its a joke til youre bullet-riddled but you should give little shit what i think this whole world is a mess gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest and a glock just to go watch batman

colorado so get lost waldo my souls escapin through this asshole that is gapin a black hole and im swallowin this track whole better pack toilet paper but im taking no crap ho here i go down the bat pole and im changing back into that old maniac in fact there they go tryin to dip out the back-door retreatin cause everybody knows  ", " holy mackerel im the biggest jerk on the planet earth i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull for thinkin we had some magnetic pull then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin magnets work cause youre attractive but we aint attractable
