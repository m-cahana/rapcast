{"lupe fiasco": ["  ba shoutout to lupe fiasco lowkey akala fitb aotp it and boonaa. real recognizes real ya hear  im really stuck in the belly of the beast if i dont make it out here then i wont have food to eat because unfortunately my debts are kinda steep with so much on my plate its only right that i see a feast with a quran in one hand im trying to practice what i preach but feeling hypocritical cuz im searching for the road to riches aint gonna be easy when ur surround with all these snitches get rich or die trying whoever said it was poor im only looking forward and wont let the world deter me but this world is so cold and you still never heard me used to have plans of being rich by the time i was thirty now im trying to get money long and legal to take care of my people but these ignants take me for a joke and say im too young say you can only bring change with a barrel of a gun so like those that came before me i gotta go hard but its hard finding a way without getting barred im not for stunting cuz these people will kill you a struggle is not really something you can chill through so im trying to pray on time because thats something i still do look into my eyes and you can see what ive been through you know what im doing they call it paper pursuing and even though its wrong i feel like were destined for harm it bothers me when people refer to me as smart cuz they dont know about the stats on my card me and my beliefs can never be apart and thats why im keeping the lord in my heart  prophet over profit may not make cents but it makes sense instead of trying to understand youd rather take offence label me a terrorist and act like its a game we are not the same im going insane what the hell are you sayin so dont be surprised if i dont like you sometimes i might even have an urge to hate you never the people im speaking about their leaders who are sending our youth to die in a war these kids dont even know what theyre fighting for when the world is this fucked up silence is a crime the little homies layin dead in a coffin theyre dying younger and far more often the rent is too high and wages way too low but were still talking about stupid songs on the radio too busy catching feelings over shit that aint your life might as well just stab yourself with a knife why do ya even care live ya own life who deceived into thinking youre inferior you have a brain focus on your interior im the guy that you just might fear but dont worry ill always be right here im the reason they tried to keep slaves from reading soon their brains will be bleeding so eadon look at what i became something like a phenom nothin but a g thang things ive seen when im looking out of these frames pictures i painted on the walls where we hang from the trees they hung strange fruit man look at how they swung now you mad when they come at ya with their tounge how the hell you gonna tell a son who aint have a father how to try to grow up and be one see umm feel it in my bones that im sittin on a throne like a killer with a chrome when i spit another poem shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home people trying way too hard just to live life never satisfied always creating unnecessary strife i dont get high life keeps me at a decent height im high off life dont need a pill in here but youre killing me i think i need will in here  they say boys will be boys so were running out of men were running out to sin chasing different women he doesnt wanna give her a ring he just wanna give her a ring he aint looking for a wifey hes looking for a fling so he treats her like a dj and takes her for a spin were celebrating our dick size chicks that we gettin whips that we hittin were playin our position instead of becoming better citizens  how quickly we forget that a woman watched us grow after being a tiny ball of flesh without any bones now behold we have the arrogance to assume we made it on our own but who were we but a piece of clot before we grew and who knew we would trace our ancestries back to a zoo we must have really come from apes with that monkey point of view  not impressed with what you claim trying to be the best in the game the weather is finally destined to change dont care about your chain or fame cuz i know from where the diamonds came when im on the mic make way for the monster if youre rapping about hoes and ur dough its already too late you sold em your soul  its not what you say its how you say it its not what you got but how you get it you think youre b-a-d find a p-e-n and p-a-d take notes then d-i-e  flow so nuts this track gettin t-bagged you be on your glory hole you dont know who ur messing with im gonna come through and shine in due time but i cant do crime not a player-hater cuz im a lady-dater and baby-maker not now but maybe later look alive these world is complicated either make it or break it free like a mason im staying in this station  so let us pray for em the hustlers money guzzlers murders wealth hoarders stealth tactics cheap tricks chasing limp dicks rapists racists those who forgot the basics of living life those who aint acting right drug dealers fakers flakers and the los angeles lakers  -----------------  big ups to boonaa mohamed for verse 3 and 4  the rest is basically a huge mash-up as a result of listening to too much hip-hop over the last 20 years  "]}
