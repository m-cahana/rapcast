{"cam'ron": ["  youre the one that never lets me sleep to my mind down to my soul you touch my lips youre the one that i cant wait to see with you here by my side im in ecstasy  i am all alone without you my days are dark without a glimpse of you but now that you came into my life i feel complete the flowers bloom my morning shines and i can see  chorus: your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world i feel the warmth inside your love is like the river that flows down through my veins i feel the chill inside  every time i hear our music play reminds me of the things that weve been through in my mind i cant believe its true but in my heart the reality is you  i am all alone without you my days are dark without a glimpse of you but now that you came into my life i feel complete the flowers bloom my morning shines and i can see  your love is like the sun that lights up my whole world i feel the warmth inside your love is like the river that flows down through my veins i feel the chill inside  "]}
