{"joe budden": ["  i must admit im kinda freaked out dont see what the big deal is all about one day it wont hurt but im not to that stage i think in time ill start to act my age and step into the story where anything goes its always been this way i suppose. hoping im doing all right i take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown this will be my saving grace that somewhere in the human race theres a girl who can replace you - just a simple cut and paste - then i see your face... where will i ever find another girl like you i must concede that ive been misled missing you keeps messing with my head. but when im alone i kind of freak out knowing what the big deal is about. - ill step into the story where anything goes its always been this way i suppose. hoping im doing all right ill take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown every night i contemplate the love you handed me was fake if i cant bend i might just break - you just might be my last mistake still im gonna take - a chance and try to find another girl like you and i want her to be a little kinder too i just want her to be - a little less like you i must admit that ive been confused and its gonna take some time to shake these blues - and step into the story where anything goes its always been this way i suppose. hoping im doing it right ill take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown way down underneath my skin theres still some love i once fell in i dont mind starting out again - if i dont play ill never win still im wondering - where will i ever find another girl like you i just want her to be...
