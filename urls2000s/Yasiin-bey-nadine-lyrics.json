{"mos def": ["  as i got on a city bus and found a vacant seat i thought i saw my future bride walking up the street i shouted to the driver hey conductor you must slow down i think i see her please let me off this bus  nadine honey is that you oh nadine honey is that you seems like every time i see you darling you got something else to do  i saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back and started walkin toward a coffee colored cadillac i was pushin through the crowd tryin to get to where shes at i was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat  nadine honey is that you oh nadine honey where are you seems like every time i catch up with you youre up to something new  downtown searching for her looking all around saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town i caught a loaded taxi paid up everybodys tab with a twenty dollar bill told him catch that yellow cab  nadine honey is that you oh nadine honey is that you seems like every time i catch up with you youre up to something new  she moves around like a wave of summer breeze go driver go go catch her for me please moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear  nadine honey is that you oh nadine honey is that you seems like every time i see you darling youre up to something new  "]}
