{"lupe fiasco": ["  were gonna start the final session of #philosophysunday in about 20 minutes from now #ps the topic is the painting used for the t&y cover  alright lets get this started the final session of #philosophysunday is live you know da rules tag ya responses wit #ps or be overlooked  before we get started i want to say thank you to everybody who has supported #philosophysunday over the years  it was started to use twitter for some a little more profound and engaging and i think we can say weve been successful  #philosophysunday would not have been possible without fans and arm chair intellectuals chiming in on the topics and striking #twittergold  i want to send a very special thank you  to @wirelessphi for giving #philosophysunday a little more philosophical credibility  hopefully you guys and gals can continue #philosophysunday with @wirelessphi or on your own with your own personal twitter accounts.  lastly i want to say sorry to all you football fans who had to make the tough lol decision 2 choose between #ps or those sunday games lol  so lets get this started. i as wasalu jaco started painting a couple years back kinda as a hobby & then got a little more serious #ps  i found out that the painting became just as meaningful as my music in terms of what idea i was trying to express. layers of meaning. #ps  story of how one of my paintings became the cover for 1 of my albums i will save for the memoirs but the painting itself we can discuss #ps  lets have a look at the painting and the cover #ps the name of the painting is in italian uomo mangiato tigre and roughly translates as man eating tiger #ps  so lets start there. what is your interpretation of the title man eating tiger remember to tag responses with #ps  rt: @lupefiasco does the man eating tiger have any reflection of the issues with you as an artist man and your label atl rec tiger #ps  rt: @lupefiasco internal struggle #ps  rt: @lupefiasco natures life cycle #ps  rt: @lupefiasco i feel like the meaning behind it may deal more so with how you say it not what youre saying. #ps  ah some very early #twittergold from @speightszn care to explain what you mean by how you say it #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man desires to become part of society and in turn consumes himself #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man conquering what would be considered a dangerous animal #ps  rt: @lupefiasco human contamination of something more vicious than it #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man becoming more ferocious then the tiger almost like a david vs. goliath also #ps  rt: @lupefiasco reversals--wildness tamed and consumed. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco chaos #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man is the top but sometimes we behave like animals..although we say we are superior thus man eatingbecoming tiger. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco because you can look at the phrase man eating tiger in two different ways. its like a double entendre of a title. #ps  ah some #twittergold from @jjlawson_ so it has two meanings #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man destruction against the last majestic and natural strengths of our world. #ps  rt: @speightszn @lupefiasco like a play on words. the tiger has gotten a taste for human blood #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the definition i see from it stems back to tigers being pouched by man. so eating man means self preservation and survival #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the response lines up w the islamic interpretation of the tiger representing money profits & honor which would be atlantic #ps  rt: @lupefiasco struggle to survive man eating tiger vs man-eating tiger #ps  great stuff...so yes the title can be read as two ways...lets expand a little bit on that. who is the man and who is the tiger #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the man being the normal man and the tiger being society itself #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the man is a anyone and the tiger is society #ps  rt: @lupefiasco that is up for you to decide... you can chose to be one or the other. or can you be both #ps  rt: @lupefiasco maybe the man and the tiger are one....this could all be about self destruction if that were the case #ps  rt: @lupefiasco it can be any david/goliath situation. western media against the muslim faith comes to mind. but its open to a lot #ps  rt: @lupefiasco if i follow-up what i said about red the tiger symbolizing carnal tones the tiger engulfs the skull the man with rage #ps  rt: @lupefiasco truly depends everyone posses both characters.  #ps  rt: @lupefiasco one in the same. #ps were animals like tigers but also theres a tiger. whats the tiger though lol #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the man = people in power keeping you as the tiger contained and essentially eating the life and inspiration from you #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the man is the industry the tiger is the artist. the industry poaches artists for their talents. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco well the man has always been the guy in charge and we are all animals so youre the tiger #ps  rt: @lupefiasco it depends on the situation; for example man could be the average joe and his tiger could be the daily grind of a 9-to-5 #ps  rt: @lupefiasco depends on who is saying it; everyone can say theyre the man/ tiger when its convenient #ps  ah very interesting #twittergold . the changing of identities. adaptation or masquerading@gvanx #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the tiger is the government and the man is the taxpayer. nobody really knows who controls who. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco why shouldnt we be the tiger fighting internally and man could be society in a conceptualized collective perspective #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man is the people tiger is the current establishment in the concrete jungle #ps  very great stuff you guys could be tour guides at the prado lets shift to the other word in the title: eating. thoughts #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating what whos eating #ps  rt: @lupefiasco engulfing overwhelming controlling #ps  rt: @lupefiasco whats the meal #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating is control. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco being swallowed by its environment #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating could refer to a conflict between the man inside us and the tiger.. civilized vs instincts  rt: @lupefiasco captivity of negativity #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating could mean conquering... #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating can be synonymous with greed. double burger with cheese.....#ps  rt: @lupefiasco consumption of morality #ps  rt: @lupefiasco i look at eating as a pleasure & i see the two entities man or tiger finding pleasure in getting rid of the other. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating could mean conquering or destroying #ps  rt: @lupefiasco trying to be controlled #ps  rt: @lupefiasco consuming and profiting at the expensive of the victim #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating as in destroying the tigers habitat #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating could mean the tiger is taking your life away or your rights #ps  rt: @lupefiasco killing/eating your inner artist. making you discouraged to pursue and keep producing your art. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco it can be consuming sustenance a necessity for survival or gluttony succumbing to desire. #ps  fun fact: i dont use the whole title when i talk about this painting with friends. i just call it the mangiato or the eating #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the eating is still in process. eternal consumption. consumerism  #ps  ah some professional #twittergold from @wirelessphi a continuum of consumption how please expand for us... #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating symbolizes survival #ps  rt: @lupefiasco any form of consumption be it eat indulge be taken over by etc. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco drinking the koolaid taking everything in; gullible you are what you eat. #ps  ah #twittergold from @mickystweeting i never looked at it that way. you are what you eat so the tiger picks up human traits #ps  rt: eating can symbolize reward. the man you is being rewarded through all the challenges atlantic tiger put you through. #ps @lupefiasco  rt: @lupefiasco in this case eating = exploitation #ps  rt: @lupefiasco tiger = bourgeoisie man= proletariat both in never-ending contest. the purple looks like a scab the wounds from revolt #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating doesnt necessarily mean that the other doesnt exist anymore. can it refer to become one #ps  ah #twittergold from @heyhappymonday so this painting isnt a violent scene of consumption its something softer #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man consumes but is consumed by his consumption. cant escape the cycle--always needs fiercer tigers to keep him entertained #ps  rt: @lupefiasco its all about perspective we could pick up the tigers traits. savage regressive behavior is omnipresent.. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco never ending consumption. an indulgent of some sort probably along the lines of obsession or addiction. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco #ps man eating tiger man. eating. tiger. man eating tiger. man=eating tiger. man eating=tiger.  great way to put it  in an equation form #twittergold from @drownsomebody82 fun fact: there is a lot of math used in philosophy #ps  lets move away from the title and look at the painting itself. what do u see what is what #ps rt: @lupefiasco a skull most likely representing man #ps  rt: @lupefiasco i see bars and sculls #ps  @wwjrhrd: @lupefiasco why the frame for fanciness...lol #ps  rt: @lupefiasco for one i can see that the red skull might symbolize violence #ps  rt: @lupefiasco self contained...straight lines...the skull is the only thing that deviates #ps  rt: @lupefiasco those 2 brush strokes remind me of a tiger ripping through the man or vice versa #ps  rt: @lupefiasco i see the red from the skull and the red and purple line are parallel could this be stating they connect with each other #ps  rt: @lupefiasco colors of a tiger and a human skull #ps  rt: @lupefiasco #ps rt: @lupefiasco i see fresh death which is covered in red an also a blue streak an we know only sonic is fast enough to make that streak #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the skull is fading away. beinf destroyed by this red shape as an all consuming rage  lemme help yall out a little: there is a man a tiger flesh blood bone and my two favorites..a soul & technology see them now #ps  there is also some brain in there...grey matter see it #ps  rt: @lupefiasco purple=wounds  brown and red=blood trail pink=loss of innocence white=innocencebeginnings tan=guilt...red skull=death #ps  rt: @lupefiasco i see the tiger being hidden away in the background the man is trying to consume and cover the tiger but cant completely #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the soul may be the blue stripe #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the lines in the art in different angles convey how eating the tiger isnt straight forward its complex difficult. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco having a soul and ability to create technology separates us from the animal instinct/thirst for blood. #ps  @yellow_arigo35: @lupefiasco where is the technology #ps the silver color field in the upper left #ps  rt: @lupefiasco duality of man the thirst for knowledge/innovation but is also consumed by his primal nature #ps  some #twittergold to take back to the ktt @oilgangebro  rt: @lupefiasco are all those things in the painting or in the viewer who finds them there and the artist who put them there for us to find #ps  @mo_yasini: @lupefiasco im struggling to see the brain/grey matter #ps bottom far right...smallest thing used in the painting #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the silver tech being bigger in area than the grey brain makes it seem like youre saying tech will overcome us #ps  rt: @lupefiasco my take on the painting. #ps rt: @lupefiasco smallest thing used and often forgotten but most important part of the human process #ps  rt: @lupefiasco   #ps tiger is apex predator. with the brain  and tech man manages to become a danger to the highest in the food chain  #ps  wooh some #twittergold from @mrbrpeters but when man enters nature without all the technological superiority... #ps  rt: @lupefiasco i feel like you are trying to say that we are becoming over-dependant on technology therefore not using our brains that much #ps  rt: @lupefiasco @mrbrpeters hes at the mercy of nature #ps  rt: @lupefiasco but man is the most adaptable animal entering the wilderness without technology does not preclude him from creating it. #ps  great stuff...lets wrap it up... final thoughts on uomo mangiato tigre or the eating as i like to call it... #ps  rt: @lupefiasco it feels like epiphenomenalism the duality between mind & body & technologys affect on it. the tiger symbolizes our instinct.  rt: @lupefiasco man must stay focused and not let society the tiger alter their thoughts and break them down #ps  rt: @lupefiasco humans are ruining them self #ps  rt: @lupefiasco nothing is as evil as we see it to be. its all perspective. everything is trying to find their own place in this world. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man and tiger in a constant battle over who is the superior predator. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man is oppresses the tiger because of technology but without it the tiger wins out. man-eating tiger man eating tiger #ps  rt: @lupefiasco eating is living life good from bad decisions drug dealing until tiger police takes your life and locks you in a cage #ps  rt: @lupefiasco uomo mangiato tigre is life today as we know it. and we need to appreciate ourselves more then materials #ps  rt: @lupefiasco the paintings meaning as a whole to me is a man trying to hide corruption the tiger tech but there is still hope pink #ps  rt: @lupefiasco lets just call it mans battle with the world and nature in his eternal bid to understand himself. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco it further adds to the bigger discussion thatll be expanded in ur lp so like a quintuple entendre.. art tracklist songs #ps  rt: @lupefiasco we are depending more on technolgy than our brians #ps  rt: @lupefiasco how bout technology being  the tiger thats eating the man. we feast on it. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco a lot of things going on but it seems to tap into a deeper lesson for man. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco #ps delicious. mouthwatering colours.  rt: @lupefiasco who you are without and with technology #ps  rt: @lupefiasco it is sometimes necessary to be ruthless in order to avoid being consumed by this savage world.. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco its about resilience you keep going even though they try to stop you #ps  rt: @lupefiasco human progress is like a bell curve which will eventually bring itself down #ps  rt: @lupefiasco be careful what boundaries you draw between yourself and the world around you. #ps  rt: @lupefiasco no matter how advanced we become as a civilization we will always be driven by animalistic impulses #ps  rt: @lupefiasco man is trying to live with both tiger and technology with our sacrificing his soul to tech and body and blood to tiger #ps  rt: @lupefiasco before wrapping it up can we know your interpretation of it #ps  sure @rimzs for me as the guy who painted it. i see a tiger descending into the body of a man being consumed. you see the inside of man  but i also see a tiger in the process of ripping a man to pieces. a very chaotic scene of violence.  @rimzs  the meaning of this painting is constantly shifting and changing. i see death and life and a constant pursuit of these two goals. @rimzs  so lets end it here big shouts to everyone who participated in the final session of #philosophysunday i hope you enjoyed it  special
