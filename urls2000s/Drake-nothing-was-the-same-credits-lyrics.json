sample credits: deborah mannis-gardner / dmg clearances inc cover art: kadir nelson art direction & design: isa saalabi and donald hearn  a lot of people get famous and then dont want to be famous you signed up for this you gotta pay for it. a lot of people just dont know what the price is when they step up to the plate. the wear and tear is not physical. the wear and tear is a mental thing. you really just let go of a lot of relationships that require presence and constant nurturing. you say goodbye to people people get sick and die when youre gone and a lot of things just go by the way side. then theres all the strife and power and money and control.               - ross valory  theyll never truly know but thank you to all who try to understand nothing was the same this album is dedicated to the memory of evelyn sher and bruce smith  "]}
