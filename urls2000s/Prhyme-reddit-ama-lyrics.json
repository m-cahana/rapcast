{"royce da 5'9": ["  royce - can we expect another bad meets evil album in the future you never know -nickle- whats up do you guys have any favorite songs off your own album premier--my favorite is u looz and you should know premier any truth to the rumors that you produced a song for 2pac shakur while he was signed to death row records premier--i never produced with 2pac but i have a song for whenever i need to use it on acapella. one day it will come out when i put a beat to it royce who was your biggest inspiration growing up there were many.. cool j was a huge one -nickle- premo & royce. first off thanks so much for working together and breathing some life into hip hop. a couple questions: 1 whats a short back story as to how you guys linked up to doing phryme 2 what was the biggest challenge working together logistics scheduling styles 3 were you surprised that this happened its been a long time since the release of boom thanks again  premier-- 1. mike herrard who works at shady brought the idea to us for a slaughterhouse ep of 5 songs...after scheduling everyone was taking too long royce and i decided to do it together and that turned it into a full lp 2. the biggest challenge for me was producing a full lp with only sampling adrian younges catalog of music. but royce convinced me to give it a chance. i am happy that i took the chance to do something different. now we have prhyme december 9th. 2 3. im not surprised street hop was supposed to kind be a full lp but we have made it now who do you think will have a better showing at ether on saturday bizzy bone or cassidy yes bizzy bone is now on the card opponent aint been announced any info that you can share about total slaughter 2 if it going to happen who some names that might be on the show why yall let joe put the mic down though lol i dunno who will do better. im a fan of both guys.. total slaughter is definitely happening again.. i just got real busy with prhyme.. i didnt let joe put the mic down lol he did that on his own -nickle- what was it like when you found out that your music was going to be featured in grand theft auto iii did you have any clue that the game would become such a huge success also do you have any advice for an up and coming rap group www.youtube.com/watchv=ygpesjud3tg i had a feeling the game was gonna be huge.. i actually got a first look at it and was honored... my only advice would be to believe in yourself.. thats most important -nickle- are the rumours true about your beef with biggie and if so what was it about me and big never had beef. there was some issues regarding one of my artists jeru the damaja but that got taken care of  did that all come about from one day can you touch on what caused the split between yourself and jeru his music has never been the same without you  premier--one day did spark the controversy. i went thru the motions but all is well and me and big cleared it up before he died. plus big was never called out on that record at all. speculation can sometimes lead to the wrong point getting across. as for jeru he and i are totally fine. we split over a business decision. we are gonna work this year on some new stuff how do you prepare to make an album take a deep breath and just start writing -nickle- hey royce and preme great job with the album especially getting it done and out so quickly. will there perhaps be a sequel you knew someone was going to ask. royce what do you think your greatest strengths and weaknesses are as an emcee also for preme - what is the status of the other collaborations you are said to have in the works - especially the one with pete rock which i have been looking forward to for years premier--we have talked about doing a sequel but we will see later down the line after this one comes out. as for the pete rock album we are doing a single in january to start the project. he is producing half of it and i am doing the other half eh prem why dont rap producers remix ish anymore what can we do to bring the remix back word right ive done a few for sam smith and i did a disclosure remix for latch....we will be dropping some prhyme remixes with special guests is there an album that you feel influenced you time & time again life after death.. it was written and the blueprint preemo im an 80s baby born/raised in ny queens and so im a huge fan of that grimey gritty heavy bass beats that were prevalent back in the 90s. my question is do you think that kind of sound will ever make a come back or do you think that particular sound had its time and its no longer as relevant in todays hip hop culture shit  thats what i still do. there should be hundreds more of me doing the same thing. theres no excuse to ignore the sound of new york and you come from the birthplace of hip hop culture. do what you love not what is trending can we expect more prhyme after this album well whats crazy is that we have the option to do whatever so were keeping that option ope -nickle- two questions - 1. i know youre planning to tour in support of this album - any idea on when dates will be posted and will there be an stl one 2. question for royce - will there be a bar exam 4 please say yes. 1. the tour dates will be posted very soon. as in days. lol 2. working on a lot now but ill never rule out a bar exam 4. -nickel  you better come back to australia dec 9th well be announcing dates and routing.. as far as be4... id love to hahaha -nickle-  premier-- 1. yes we will tour february. still working out the dates royce who was your idol growing up sugar ray leonard -nickle- royce did anyone get their ass beat for misspelling your legal name on the back cover of death is certain nah lol -nickle-  royce how has working with eminem now changed from how it was back in the slim shady lp days weve both grown as people and as artists so we push each other a little more lyrically these days -nickle- when is glasshouse coming out 2015 fa sure -nickle- premier why dont you open a club in houston i have one for you already. lee van richardson lee van  whats up man...im not the club business guy. it would have to make sense on a business level for me to do that. i wouldnt count it out but the numbers etc. would have to add up. r.i.p. keith bowdre.... loving your style as of late royce any chance you tour up to canada thank you and absolutely -nickle- royce big fan ive been listening since the bar exam days lol...anyway who is the funniest member of slaughterhouse theyre all pretty funny guys -nickle- dj premier: whats it like working with royce royce: whats it like working with premo loved vegas you go in. premier--working with royce is always easy. he is a perfectionist and so am i. we never have a dull moment ever. chemistry is key to great records being made and we have that whats one thing no one would expect about yourself premier--that i am a huge rock & roll fan. i know my shit and i go to many many many concerts...genesis van halen ac/dc rush iron maiden the police ozzy osbourne motley crue.... dj premier i assume you have one of the dopest record collections ever. what are some of your personal favorite vinyls you own premier-- my david axelrod lps all of my jackson 5 albums james brown parliament ohio players curtis mayfield al green willie hutch aretha franklin luther vandross maze minnie ripperton earth wind & fire barry white henry mancini sooooooomany more... royce youre the man any chance we hear a truth or truth part 2 before slaughterhouses next album weve done a few in that chamber since -nickle- whats the worst job youve ever had i worked at 7-11 oil dispatch and a department store all at the same time -nickle- are you still working on christina aguileras new album if so what can you tell us about the tracks i just sent her some new tracks. i dont know what she is going to use yet. we will soon see. shes about to get married so i know that is her focus right now hey ryan and chris im a big fan of shady records as well as premiers work one of the best producers ever so i was really looking forward to this prhyme joint im glad you decided to do this ama. i have a few questions i wont ask nothing about budden lol 1 how many videos for the album are you planning on shooting is it gonna be anything like 50s animal ambition - a video for every song 2 why was the courtesy video so short that entire track is really dope i wish the video was longer btw my favorite line from the song is daddy taught me if the ass is so fat its a fact / that if you with your ho dont matter its still appropriate to scope at it lol 3 whats your favorite track on the album hopefully youll both answer mines prhyme for now i also really like courtesy wishin and dat sound good 4 not a question but you two should break down some of the prhyme tracks on rap.genius royce recently did an interview about shadyxv with joel and crooked and we would like to hear something about this project as well im gonna risk sounding corny a.f. but your music is really helping me through some tough times right now cant wait for the album to drop premier-- 1. we plan on shooting a video to every song on the lp 1. there is a longer version but there were parts that could not be shot to complete it in time. so we did not want to waste the footage so we released it as a commercial to set up the lp coming out for now 2. i love wishin u looz and microphone preem. it changes by the day what is your favorite track off prhyme does premo rhyme at all on the album he speaks with his hands on the album.. its pretty amazing... i love all of the songs.. theyre like my kids -nickle-  premier--i spit 2 bars on u looz....enjoy because i dont rap lol do you use any daw software or do you still just use an mpc sequencer mpc renaissance is software but the formula is the same approach as analog. i did the entire prhyme lp on it and it is the first album that i used it for hey premier im a huge fan i was inspired to start producing hip-hop beats after listening to your music for a long time. do you have any advice for upcoming producers who are starting out study the great ones that have a long history of greatness under their belt. you must study just like football and basketball players study film. this is a professional business it is fun but must be taken serious in order to place yourself amongst us let me say royce youre my favorite rapper first off and preem youre my favorite dj. now that thats out of the way on to the questions for both of you guys 1. any tips for a young upcoming rapper 2. what is your favorite song youve ever done 3. are you coming to new jersey anytime soon believe in yourself is the advice i always give bro -nickle-  premier-- 1. compare yourself to artist that you highly respect to see where you fit in. you should want those artists to speak your name when you put some music out i have no favorite song. i love em all if new jersey sends for me i am there. i play anywhere both of your top 5 favorite albums premier-- not in order 1. eric b. & rakim--paid in full 2. run-dmc-raising hell 3. ll cool j--radio 4. boogie down productions--criminal minded 5. public enemy--yo  bum rush the show preme whats your favorite beat youve produced royce what do you think is your best verse ever damn.. i dont think i could name one -nickle-  premier---i dont have a favorite beat. too many to count. i like listening to other peoples music honestly. i make mine to put out to the universe. i love a lot of songs that ive done but not one singles out the others primo im a huge fan all your tracks are amazing. if you werent spinning for a living/passion what would you see yourself doing what do you think would have happened if you didnt go after your career as a dj man i dont really know....i love football but i got hurt on my motorcycle years ago and that pretty much ended that career. im blessed to do music as a profession hey whats up royce and preemo cant wait for the album to drop. like what ive been hearing i wanted to ask were there any artists that you wanted a feature from on the album but werent able to get in time also are there any artists that everybody should look for that are on the come up thanks guys black thought of the roots but we are getting him on the wishin remix. his manager had just died so he was not in the mood to write and record. more remixes coming and a 3 song deluxe bonus cuts coming who are you listening to the most these days are there any up and comers we should be watching out for look out for kid vishis -nickle- yo i cant wait to buy that prhyme album but how soon is glasshouse coming out keep it 100 nickle i need some more slaughter its coming my brother -nickle- is it true that ed sheeran came to work with you due to christina aguileraa back to basics why didnt your tracks make his album i worked with ed sheeran last year on a song called the manor. it is still coming out what is a hobby of yours that people might not expect boxing -nickle- are you still using mpcs or have you upgraded to modern hardware how do you think your production has changed over the years oh one more thing will you start producing mop albums again i am using the mpc renaissance. it is pretty much the same ad the 60 except it is equipped with more sample time and capable of using plug ins from outboard gear that i still use from the 90s as for m.o.p. i am on the upcoming lp. i did 5 so far. they have an ep out now but that was just to stall while they finish recording the album. they wanted to save mine for that instead i have been waiting for you two do be a collective since i first heard royces hip hop. any plans on touring and will you hit ireland you work amazing together just as good as gang starr was imo. rip guru we plan to eventually hit every citycountry etc -nickle-  premier-- the tour details are being worked out so stay tuned. but yes we will tour preme- you ever consider writing a book hip hop history stories would be dope especially stories about big lrip and other greats royce- you gonna hop in the battle rap scene and start killing foos and throw hands im open to the idea -nickle-  premier--i am doing a book with harry allen helping me on it. i also want to do a proper gang starr book. stay tuned preemo im a huge fan finally been able to start getting my name a bit more recognized as a producer and i owe a huge part of that to you as i have listened to your production religiously over the past few years my question is do you ever run into a sort of writers block when it comes to finding samples and if you do how do you overcome this prhyme is amazing btw. i cant get over the beat changes on wishin. great stuff from both you and royce premier-- yes i get writers block all of the time...you just have to go back to it with a fresh head and somehow it comes. everyday is not meant to be the day that a song will come out great. but it finally does. stay in your zone and shut the phones off and ignore everyone while you are creating premier who would you put in your top 5 all time premier--rakim krs-one chuck d melle mel big daddy kane royce congratulations on your sobriety how do you do it as someone who struggles with substances its a really tough fight for me. how can someone with your fame wealth and free lifestyle manage to remain sober for that long do you have any tips or words of encouragement id appreciate anything well you have to want to stop.. i reached a point in my life where i just felt it was time.. i knew i needed help and i couldnt do it on my own so i reached out to who could help me.. admitting that youre powerless over whatever youre addiction is is probably the biggest act of strength you could ever portray hey just wanted to say first off you guys album is great and its gonna be on rotation for a while. all the songs are dope and i especially love ab-souls feature on there. question for premo what was your favorite beat to make ever my personal favorite beat of yours is probably work or nas is like i do not have a favorite beat. too many to focus on 1 favorite preem huge fan of your work love all of your shit all the way from no more mr nice guy up until phryme you are probably my all time favorite producer and i dont think that will ever change that being said why you gotta break my heart all the time. you announce some amazing projects like your collabs with people like nas krs one & pete rock but then we never hear anymore. i know the nas project is held up by label shit but what about you and krs or pete would love to hear some info on this also i saw you and pete when you came to australia for your back2back tour and it was fucking amazing. thank you so much for that night even though you were late i know pete has been talking about the fact that he wants to make a reunion album with cl since guru passed do you have any information on that thanks for blessing us with so much amazing music over the years. you truly are one of the greatest producers of all time guru rip the nas lp you are correct. he has to finish his commitments to def jam first. as for krs we did 3 songs and then he went on tour. havent heard from him since but thats what krs does so when the time is right it will happen. as for pete rock we both had other commitments that had to come first so that is just how our industry goes. dont count them out though....i still continue to put music out if you are really keeping up with me prem im a big fan of you what do you think of j dilla premier-- dilla is my dude. we hung out together many of times. he was with me when i recorded devils pie with dangelo. i have the picture. this was before he was sick and alchemist came with me....alchemist looks like a little kid back in 1998...r.i.p. dilla dawg ayo preemo when are you gonna produce for k-rino hes so dope but needs better production premier--k-rino is on the new nygz lp. their lp will finally get a release date in january. the song he did with us is called introduction to manhood along with lil fame of m.o.p....k-rino got busy on it. he and i talked about doing an album preme can you tell us a good guru story none of us would have heard and what really went down with solar premier--i have many stories but too much to type. as for solar i dont want to give him any shine. he dont deserve anything coming from me so i will stay positive to avoid all negative fronts preemo: did any other pop/r&b singers approach you for beats after your success with xtinas back to basics album miguel ed sheeran anthony hamilton rizzle kicks becky hill royce prhyme and 2014 forest hills drive j cole come out the same day what you think about i dont really think about it -nickle- royce and preme- what are some of your favorite clothing brands to wear i dont usually shop brands.. i go for looks.. i really like layering.. im a winter and fall dresser -nickle- royce huge fan for a long time wanted to ask if there is any untold funny memories you can talk about the great late proof too man great memories with gawd... he was the truest -nickle- first i am a huge fan of both of you and thanks for doing this ama  with that being said do you think the bar has been set very high for this album with great albums already dropped this year such as rtj2 and ab-soul  yes the bar is set extremely high.. were up for the challenge tho -nickle-  premier-- the bar should always be set high. i would never want to be an alright  artist. i strive for excellence on a super high level at all times how many songs did you guys record for this album 9 -nickle- primo- whats your best kanye west story royce- how did you wind up on i wanna be bad hahah they reached out and asked me to be a part of it. i liked the song so i did it -nickle- first off great album. i loved every track and i truly enjoyed the features ranging from mac miller to jay electronica royce as a fellow detroiter from metro-detroit actually but you get what i mean i am well aware of your love for detroit and support for the city. allow me to express my appreciation for that i have a few quick questions: whats your daily routine in other words whats an average day for royce da 59 like also do you record using studios primarily in michigan or do you prefer to record elsewhere i.e. los angeles new york thank you my brother.. a day for me consists of gym studio and more studio lol... i use mr porters studio in op -nickle- are there any unheard big l tracks in your vault or ones that you know about big l rip yall gonna keep making dope ass music together big ls estate with all of his unreleased music is being worked out so for now it is on hold favorite memory of christina aguilera premier-- my favorite memory was hanging in the studio with her snoop dogg bishop don magic juan giving her a wedding gift while we were recording flava flav coming to her house with warren g playing mario cart. shes my little sister. love her to death what would both of you say is the highlight of your careers so far premier--my highlight was meeting james brown what happened to the songs you worked with christina aguilera on her bionic album premier-- she decided not to use them. all good. we never recorded vocals. just laid the tracks if christina aguilera made you executive producer of her next album what direction would you take her in and why premier-- lets just say the entire lp would be a massive hit. i would love to do a whole executive production of getting her the best songs ever because she can fuckin sang  if you could have christina aguilera duet with anyone for a track you produced who would it be and why mary j. blige. because they both have soul and not too many singers nowadays have that. without soul you are just a basic singer. there is a difference favorite christina aguilera song that you worked on and favorite christina aguilera song that you did not work on premier-- my favorite christina aguilera song is back in the day my favorite that i did not work on is welcome hey royce i cant wait for your guys new album to drop ill pre-order it asap i promise ha broke college student here but every time you and premier get together its a guaranteed hit. not to mention you got many other sick artists to colab with that you havent before. that being said is there a track that you enjoyed making the most or had the most fun on ive always wondered if artists had favorite songs on their own album ha we had fun doing them all.. never a dull moment -nickle- whats it like working working with each other its amazing preme is one of if not the greatest producers ever. whats there not to love about working on an entire project with him -nickel royce - what are your top three favorite albums youve made prhyme.. death is certain and bar exam 2 -nickle-  "]}
