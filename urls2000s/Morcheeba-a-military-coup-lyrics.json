{"missy elliot": ["  when the tower tumbled we began anew had no time for warning only d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu  it comes flashing back then just fades to black all gone  all the land rejoices now the coast is clear no more silent voices to whisper in your year  i am in my element with a panoramic view theres no inspiration like a military coup  children blowing kisses strangers to the truth carrying the wishes of a bygone youth  bye-bye cabaret sci-fi agony all gone  all the land rejoices now the coast is clear no more silent voices to whisper in your ear  i am in my element with a panoramic view theres no compensation like a military coup  a mellow melody rolling endlessly how long how long how long  "]}
