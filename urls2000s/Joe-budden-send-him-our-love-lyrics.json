come valentines day the game will merge to the west and i feel its absurd that the east is the sellin the less screamin new york. new york the pioneers supposed to be the best you blame it on the vets for our current state of the game they wont retire so the generation just remain the same a bunch of opportunists that was given opportunity to make a difference in music but gave no opportunity nothing new or fresh its just the same ass sound same old producers with the same ass sound up and coming artists got identity crisis cause whenever you you the labels turn you away but when you me you think of a way to cast the criticism aside get on a track say what the fuck you wanna say the radios goin to play whatever the listeners say they should and not what the listeners say they should indeeed they should indeed i should smack a few niggas like suge but then there theyll blackball me and thats a long story no crossover so i wrote the crossover but if the album sell out id be considered a sellout the fans keep asking whens the album going to come out ask your local execs im out  "]}
