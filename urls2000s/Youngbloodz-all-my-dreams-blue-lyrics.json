{"youngbloodz": ["  the time has come now for me to leave you to stop my foolish hanging on to yesterdays dream of tomorrows true love the shadow cast by childrens new love there is no time for tears or talking there is no time for you no time for you time has painted all my dreams blue pieces falling all around you around you around you around you  the doorstep of your heart is cluttered with broken dreams and pieces of the world we once lived in a world for dreamers a world of warm words sparkling colors that shone to keep us through days of wishing and nights of coming true coming true time has painted all my dreams blue pieces falling all around you around you around you around you  the place is empty my eyes are red now but hopelessness is not forgotten days of living and nights of dying streets of talking rooms of crying where is the end to all this sadness where is the end of you the end of you time has painted all my dreams blue pieces falling all around you around you around you around you around you around you around you  "]}
