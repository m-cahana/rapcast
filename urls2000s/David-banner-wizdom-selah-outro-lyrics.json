{"david banner": ["", "   when i think about things. they happen i can actually do what i think about. im so powerful i need to give more honor to that. the divine power in me and be deliberate. why would i allow myself to drift when i can direct it i was born with the instructions. right and exact consciousness inner guidance knowing choosing how to act in every situation. i create me. believe it. turning thoughts into things. turning vibrations i feel into thoughts. impulses i receive\u2026 wait let me back this thing up to the source so i can get a hold on it. think about yourself. when you lay yourself down on your bed your ears can still hear a voice when no one is talking aloud. when you close your eyes you can still see things. raise your energy up the god box and stretch your awareness. there is really nowhere that you cant reach. which shows what you have dominion & influence on. you already came with the instructions. nature naturally grows toward the light. i mean youre just a receiver. receive the message and your path is formed automatically and the sun continues to shine. even if we put an umbrella up to block the light. i mean life isnt happening its responding to us. and naturally we return to our internal flame  "]}
