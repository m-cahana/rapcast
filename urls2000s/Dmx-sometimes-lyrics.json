{"dmx": ["", "   sometimes i wonder what lifes about sometimes i wonder why the lights are out sometimes i wonder why i like to shout sometimes i wonder what the lies are bout sometimes i see things i shouldnt have seen sometimes i wonder why im a hood and a fiend sometimes i look at what ive become and cry sometimes i get on that bullshit and be ready to die sometimes a nigga thats your man might get it sometimes even though its sweet if you aint with it sometimes the pain is too much to bear sometimes it rains too much to care sometimes if you dont watch your back itll cost you sometimes you wonder who would give a fuck if they lost you yet sometimes the sun shines around the clock but sometimes its dark and hell is hot  "]}
