{"young gunz": ["  dearly beloved we are gathered here today* to lament the loss of honesty to the art of saving face of vanity and opacity a generation lost beneath the waves  loose lips sink ships and were all going down  were in the throes of vertigo higher is impossible sink like a stone let it all go higher is impossible  the oceans rise to break the bow and i find peace within the sound of water rushing in so bid farewell to all you know take your place way down below well sleep beneath the waves  loose lips sink ships and were all going down  were in the throes of vertigo higher is impossible sink like a stone let it all go higher is impossible  loose lips sink ships and were all going down  were in the throes of vertigo higher is impossible sink like a stone let it all go higher is impossible  loose lips sink ships and were all going down  so slowly we drift down and all our kings are dead now  "]}
