{"6": ["", "  ferrari sheppard: so whats going on man  yasiin bey: so im in germany right now and im about to do a set tonight with archie shepp and attica blues which is a blessing. just a blessing. you know i got a place in paris i been out here several days over the past year so yea this is a heavy one. let me say this too though man none of this stuff is separated. everything from tamir rice to the paris shooting to whats happening to the students in university of missouri to whats happening in wits university to what i been experiencing in the negative in south africa is all connected its all the same thing. its just these forces right that are looking to just turn the world into a brutal place and to turn people into machines. and its two things man that i want you to spread out. and im not on twitter im not on instagram or none of that stuff and i appreciate people like you who are using their platform for some good things. but i need everybody i need anybody anybody with a twitter account facebook whatever. this is the time to be talking about the dignity and nobility of being a human being. not a machine not a puppet of the state. of your own desires. for the sanctity and divinity and nobility of being a human being because this is whats really at stake. they trying to turn us into machines or just high functioning mammals animals beasts in a jungle that they create the state the politicians the so-called doers of good who claim to have the interests of the planet at heart and its a lie and its proven itself to be more and more of a lie every day. right people do all of this stuff to the state but the state hates the people. it is suspicious of people and its only there to use people for their benefit. it made people shadows and husks of themselves. this is what these paris attacks are about. and by the way a big giant fuck off to isis. you dont represent nothing about islam or nothing about the prophet. and another giant fuck off to everybody who trying to say geez this is islams fault. islam aint got nothing to do with colonialism or white power or none of that. and neither do christianity or none of that stuff. people try to use these beautiful faiths to justify the nonsense and bullshit and just as much as charlatans and posers and mall rats walking around with skateboards. you lying. you dont represent nothing you represent yourself. you represent bloodlust. youve been paid and bought for by people who wanna turn this gods gift this spaceship earth into a hell and cell. you represent nobody you aint out here for the common good you out here for you. your small little narrow-minded bigoted dumb-ass beliefs. it has nothing to do with the greater good you aint helping nobody you aint for the muslims you aint for nobody. you a hazard to everybody. stop trying to claim us like you here for us youre not. its not what the prophet was about  the last words of the quran  lakum d\u012bnukum wa liya d\u012bni \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u200c\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u200c\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e \u200c\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0650  - to you be your way and to me be mine. im not here to defend the sanctity of islam. thats not what im talking about we are human beings we on a spaceship we all on the same spaceship. we all here together man i read these comments on this damn internet these comment pages man people are treating each other so poorly bruh people dont know how to disagree even man. thats the measure of a civilization brother not how well you agree but how well you can disagree. thats civilized. all of what were leaving for our children what examples are we leaving to our children man everybody need to read the universal declaration of human rights. post it up. put it on your twitter. everybody. and charlie chaplins speech from the great dictator. we live by each others happiness not each others misery. and this is the misery bruh that you just heaping and heaping upon the world. the state kills the children and says they justified in murdering children. they kill unarmed people and say that they justified in doing it. i mean everybody whos sad about paris should be just as sad and angry about tamir rice. how all these young innocent people dying over nothing. dying over somebodies greed dying over their antiquated backwards ass beliefs that they arent human. cry for them. and leave comments for them. and make the un acknowledge the universal declaration of human rights as a law. cause furthermore with hollande talking about closing the borders how are you gonna put innocent people under suspicion for crimes that they didnt commit. closing these borders does not bring back any of them dead people. not one of them. and if its all about prevention thats nonsense. i dont think francois hollande cares any more about the parisian people than isis. i really really dont. their response as usual is to throw more people into more panic more frenzy theres nothing theres nothing wise about these types of responses. its all meant to just get you into a reactionary phase and to start viewing your brothers and sisters you human brothers and sisters with suspicion and hatred and judgment man. we have to loving and caring about one another because guess what if we did this shit would not be going on. and we have trusted these people who say that they love us and say that theyre here for us in the names of the state and the government and democracy and the presidency and congress and everything else. we have trusted them so much. they are sickening us they are destroying our world and theyre destroying the future for our children and we cannot just idly stand by and get into these nonsense bull-rally exchange back and forth with each other just to prove how clever we are or to win a debate that dont change nothing of the conditions that we all experiencing. i dont care who you are or where you are white black rich poor jew gentile you are feeling it on this planet earth today. and mind you the people planning this knew exactly what they were doing. it was a new moon this week ok they trying to put some poison onto this one they trying to set their intentions to turn this world into a cell with everything that they doing. and they got all of us scrambling around arguing on the left arguing on the right are you conservative are you a liberal its nonsense. you know what its like dave chappelle said when they asked him they said who gon win between pacquiao and mayweather he said the promoters. thats whats happening. they promote this conflict everywhere. its the muslims versus the christians its the heterosexuals versus the homosexuals its the women versus man its youth versus the elders its man versus nature. its always a fight theres always somebody or some small group that make money no matter what the outcome is and they promote conflict they dont promote harmony. they dont promote peace they say that but my grandmother said they say peace peace peace but they really got evil wicked intentions in their heart. they want to control people they want to control what you think how you think what you say where you say who you say it to. read that universal declaration of human rights read it. post it up. people need to see it and see how the majority of governments in this world are breaking every part of that agreement. people say oh its just something to be written down. well if thats the standard thats supposed to be the benchmark for how were supposed to behave as a civilization and how states are supposed to behave with their members then they have failed. they are failing and they are actually committing illegal acts. if you dont have enough knowledge of the law they need to learn the law they need to learn what the real law is what its national law is they need to stand up for the rights cause they taking all of our power away from us and using it against us to destroy us  fs: i see that i see that. i was most frustrated at the fact that weve seen this over and over and over. certain things are deemed terrorism and its the worst thing in the world and people have dependents and they light candles around the world and all of this when we been marching and crying\u2026  yb: light a candle for tamir rice. light a candle for tamir rice. he was born june 25 2002. he was 12 years old. if you got -- come on man  fs: it keeps happening. we do need the universal declaration of human rights. but i fear that its not us you and i our group who we get along who we see eye to eye with were not the ones --  yb: i aint saying nobody fuck them all man. psalms 34 verse 4 i asked the lord to deliver me and he delivered me through all my fears. he delivered me from my fears. what are we afraid of what are we afraid of you know im really more afraid of living in a world that they are proposing for us through these types of actions but for my sons and my daughters have to live in a world where they got to negotiate a relationships with these beasts disguised as human beings. and if you gonna be outraged about what they did at the bataclan by the way people can shut the fuck up i live in paris i performed at the bataclan. one of my dear friends lost somebody i dunno who i lost i dunno who i lost in that.  fs: i feel you bro  yb: i wish my french was better i would speak directly in french to the french people. listen man dont be hustled human beings dont be hustled. dont let them make you think that they care about you. yea obama was right this is an attack against humanity. and so it is when tamir rice gets shot by the police and the state say that it was justified. so is everything thats happening at the university of missouri. so is japan not telling the world the truth about fukushima thats tyranny too. so is everybody else acting like fukushima is not a problem for the earth like all of the oceans aint connected like that radioactive dust aint showing up on the shores of canada right now like its not showing up on the shores of california beaches like it aint two-headed babies out here. tyranny is tyranny period. tyranny is tyranny. if were gonna be against tyranny we gotta be against it wherever its at. it makes me think of that saying that my dad used to say to me that the government is tough on crime cause they dont like competition. ok now its some bullshit when somebody else is not licensed like james bond or some shit go ahead and kill somebody. but when they got on a uniform its cool. which stands to the sick-minded people of the world oh if i wanna kill i need to go get out here and get registered and licensed to kill. so i get me a uniform or one of these state appendages whether it be the police or the military and i subvert all of these murder impulses into that ill just aim it at whatever or whoever they tell me to aim it at. cause i was waiting for an excuse to kill somebody anyway. and what do they expect what type of society are you tryna build -- it is the trickle down theory they state run around killin people so the people like murder must be alright. im not justifying that but thats what happening. you understand what im saying who is more violent than the state against humanity people feel it when its a couple hundred people because you look at and see but nobody feel it when its half a million iraqi kids that die from sanctions or when its people going through hell in palestine. but its at more of a premium when its people in a smaller group just out tryna enjoy friday night then you feel it or when it happen to you because them kids in palestine they not you. and thats their own fault. see they showing even the media response and dont trust the media neither cause theyre not there to give you the truth and make you feel balanced or to tell you the facts. they want you to feel nervous so that you will trust the state more so that they will endorse and gratify their power and ream control over your life and ultimately you could end up feeling nervous and your cathartic response is to go to the arcade the mall the titty club wherever to offload some of that to offload that negative feeling. you wanna keep this stored up this is a raving bonanza for all these quote-unquote news media people they know all these peoples eyes is glued to the screen they in shock they in awe they hurt. like im hurt right now and in the interim theyre gon try to sell you every widget and gadget and every other useless damn thing that you can imagine cause they got you you captive. its an old axiom in the news if it bleeds it leads. so what they gotta do they gotta make sure that people stay bleeding. but see psalms 34 verse 4 i ask the lord to deliver me he delivered me from all my fears. and this quote is saying in the quran too we will not change the conditions of a people until they change what is in themselves. you are not gonna get a better world hating your fellow man. you can hate the conditions but you have to love your brother and as corny as it sounds as clever as niggas are as edgy as they wanna be got a chip on their shoulder cause its fashionable you know thats in style its very involved to be melancholy and moody and edgy and curmudgeonly. the love man love must and will prevail. i dont care how corny it sounds. i aint tryna win no swag wars who cares man. the world is in has been in a state of emergency. and i hope that these types of things make people wake up man we keep treating each other like this man if you just get rid of them they just gonna be gone. the problem is not islam the problem aint organised patriarchy. the problem is all of these things that have dysfunction to them or people who dysfunction within them these systems right. the problem is peoples lack of compassion and care for themselves and for their fellow human beings and thats what keeps all of this nonsense going. we dont treat each other well. we need to treat each other better than what were doing. and we need to stop giving our allegiance to people who are mistreating us. and the government particularly the us government many of the western governments they are mistreating their own citizens and people around the world. they have a long legacy of this and it has to stop. its illegal to deny access to this planet earth to anybody we are all on this spaceship. i dont wanna hear a muthafucking nother thing about mars. we dont deserve mars if we cant do right by earth. we dont deserve it. shut the fuck up about mars and do right by earth you wont have to fucking go to mars. by the way were already in outer space with your clever asses were already here. on this spaceship earth. the planets spinning all the time everything we need is here. i dont wanna hear nothing about colonising or nothing else. no more fucking colonial fictions and fantasies. earth is sufficient. but if we dont do right by each other we gon eliminate ourselves the trees the oceans i dont give a fat babys ass. things will continue to go on as they did. we will eliminate ourselves. please dont make bill gates right. we need to thin out the herd. you got fucking radioactive fukushima over here police running crazy i was walking around in paris i was like why all these people wanna see a motherfucking ak-47 and all that shit that dont make me feel secure. they trying to drive people into a state of high stress so people dont have the space to really slow it down love themselves and love one another and work their problems out for themselves because guess what we got the answers within us. why its these ugly knuckleheads with ties and lifelong pensions representing the people who dont represent the people. you represent yourself you represent the banks you represent the corporations you represent the nigga that keeps the tanks running around the world crushing people and taking resources out of the earth. talking about we making the world safer you destroying the world. the world that we all gotta share. and they so dumb that they think the can build some high fence where they can dominate the world from a striking safe distance and they wont be in misery. let me tell you what my grandfather used to tell me. hed tell all us that to keep a man in the hole you gotta get in that hole with him. some part of you is in that hole. if you trying to keep him in that hole some part of your mind and your spirit is right there in that hole with him. whoever you digging a hole for you really digging it for yourself.
