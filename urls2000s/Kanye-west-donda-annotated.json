{"kanye west": ["  i appreciate everyones support for my clothing line but i wanted to clarify a few things\u2026 the name of the line is kanye west not dw\u2026 the dw was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom :-. i really appreciate the fake dw twitter page but since its not official i cant co-sign any information on it simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. \u2013 leonardo da vinci more clarity\u2026 i have no agency representing me currently\u2026 william morris was fired after cara lewis quit. i love cara lewis :- i love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. its so challenging and fun and im surrounded by amazing people. they say you only live once but every time i come to work i feel like im starting a second life. you guys might think i have some type of backing for my line but i dont. i did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money i made touring to follow my passion. ive been working at this for 8 years now. from the first offers to do urban clothing lines that i turned down\u2026to begging bape to do my line and never making any real headway\u2026to having an office in la that was shut down after the mtv moment along with my tour with lady gaga i moved to japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. i had this opportunity to intern at fendi and was also offered a position at versace which i could not take due to my contract with lv which was for 2 years. i moved to rome after i left japan and worked at fendi for 4 months undercover. i was there to give ideas for the mens collection. i snuck to giuseppe zanottis factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in paris. after doing the first lv collection i was sure i would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity i designed a sneaker called the air yeezy with nike. im allowed to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. i have more ideas\u2026 early 2011 i moved to paris and opened a small design studio. the language barrier was quite difficult. i still dont have a paris vat number to this day. i dont know what a vat is but every time i asked why we didnt have fabrics they said it was because of the vat. in paris i met many great people in design including the master azzedine alaia. azzedine even came by my studio one day :-. this was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small paris studio in a courtyard opposite collate i remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. she said i would always point to the most expensive furs even as a child. lol. there is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. for the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing i knew about womens clothing was what my mom would wear. i guess some critics would joke that i still dont know anything. lol. my mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished cosby show sweater :- to pick me up from school. the teachers said i couldnt focus. i used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing nikes in 4th grade being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. i was just discussing becoming the creative director for the jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out you should do a jetsons tour this just happened a few hours ago. i was very insulted of course because for anyone thats seen the watch the throne tour coachella glow in the dark or runaway know that i have real ideas i appreciate having the most nominations at the grammys but i feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. good logic tells me smile kanye the world likes you again. red or blue pill\u2026aaaaand swallow. lol. i wouldnt have the prestige i have if it wasnt partially for the grammys validation and i honor that hmmmmm what to wear here i go again\u2026 yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim\u2026the verdict is still out. this is just a train of thought but i figure its better to read than trained thoughts what good is fame and prestige if you cant use it to help people i want to help by doing what i know how to do best\u2026create i have started a new company and im so excited about the name\u2026its got the best name ever\u2026of all companies\u2026of all time the name of the company is donda donda is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. i used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. dr dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. i am assembling a team of architects graphic designers directors musicians producers a&rs writers publicist social media experts app guys managers car designers clothing designers djs video game designers publishers tech guys lawyers bankers nutritionists doctors scientists and teachers donda will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. i want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. we want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear touch taste and feel. to dream of create advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. to marry our wants and needs\u2026donda this will all take time but i wanted everyones to know what i really care about\u2026i care about people\u2026i care about my fans\u2026i care about people who have never heard of me\u2026there are over 7 billion people on the planet now\u2026its something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-. my mom was an english teacher so i know she sends an smdh from heaven :-. 5:18 am in london my dreams keep me woke the watch the throne tour was a small example of what a donda experience can be\u2026 im currently working on a new 7 screen experience\u2026  this is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 olympics\u2026its semi sci-fi since 2016 is only 4 years away :- we would also like to design the mtv awards. were taking everything 10 steps at a time lol i wanted to put this in the world in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. we need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. come get on board\u2026dont just sit there\u2026reach out we can collectively effect the world through design. we need to pick up where steve jobs left off when i said wealthy i wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. school systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life spike jonze and i want to do a summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. math classes should teach addition subtraction multiplication division accounting and money management aaaaaand cut unless youre a math major kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iphones\u2026why not promote it allow kids to use search engines to do test\u2026like the real world give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect\u2026please excuse my grammar\u2026i know its extremely ironic some kids have better memories than others\u2026what about emotional iqs what about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are excuse me\u2026i just get excited at the possibilities\u2026the more excited i get the more grammatical errors youll see\u2026 we need to take what michael jackson felt and mcqueen and steve jobs and we need make things better when me and jay toured every night i peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us the adrenaline is running\u2026i dont know if i can even get to sleep now. from wall street to the london riots to chicago murders\u2026i sit everyday and ask what can i do to make a difference. i know this is not a very rapper thing to say but i havent bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years i invest every dime back into creativity hiring amazing creatives paying for flights offices\u2026etc. my area of expertise is in music my passion is in music design film and products\u2026my strength is connectivity\u2026 there are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems\u2026we need experts for this. we need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments i just wanted to share whats been on my mind\u2026 if you have an apple and i have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and i will still each have one apple\u2026but if you have an idea and i have an idea and we exchange these ideas then each of us will have two ideas. \u2013 george bernard shaw  "]}
