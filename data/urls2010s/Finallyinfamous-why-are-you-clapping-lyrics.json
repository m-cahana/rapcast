{"the biggest troll at this point": ["", "  dude 1 kicks open the door. he starts firing. dude 2 falls. a mist of red puff spurts from his chest. hes screaming  screams echo a deafening ring. calloused hands press thick pulsing liquid further into the fabric. something about the feel of his wet shirt pressing against raw skin the absence of life staining a pristine shirt made the stars in the back of his eyes dance. the life exiting the hole in dude 1s stomach stains the boys nikes leaving a thick layer of crimson on the soles of his feet  dude 1 aims the gun at the boy. dude 1 says something nothing is heard over the ringing. the boy would like to think that he said something meaningful but he knows better. the boy closes his eyes. this isnt the way he wanted to go but he is at peace with it  he never did find out what roscoes wetsuit meant. maybe it was better that way  ...breath.....breath.............breath.. .       silence  the boy feels cold  the boy opens his eyes. the room is now empty blood gone. the boy walks outside. the branches create rays of sunshine that cut him like blades. the boy kicks off his shoes into the pool left shoe falls into the pool while the right one falls short. the boy then walks to the pool. he sits down feet dipping in the pool. naomi sits next to him holding his hand naomi so\u2026 this is what you wanted the boy i thought so... naomi why the boy i wanted to feel something  naomi  because\u2026 the boy i just dont feel anything anymore. im\u2026 callous. i guess. i just feel like\u2026 its all meaningless. im meaningless. whats my point i dont know naomi why do you think that is  the boy thinks im afraid naomi of the boy everything then i dont know who i am anymore. i dont know\u2026 why am i here why am i alive why do you care naomi i always knew who you were. and you always knew who you were  naomi opens her left hand. a gold molar is in her palm. the boys reflection is shown in the shiny metal naomi this is who you were. this was your life. its expensive its shiny its seems to be worth a lot. but no matter what\u2026 itll never be the real thing  naomi drops the molar into the boys hand. the boy looks at it  i dont want this  he lets the tooth drop out of his hand. it sinks down to the bottom of the pool where it stays  naomi youre allowed to be better. youre allowed to grow up. if you want the boy how naomi just get off the bus\u2026 the boy but youre here now\u2026  naomi begins to stand up  you have to help me\u2026  naomi begins to walk away  i need you. you have to help me\u2026  naomi continues to walk away. ignoring the boy  you have to help me\u2026  naomi doesnt acknowledge the boy. she just keeps walking away slowly  you have to help me. please help me. please help me. please  naomi stops walking. the boy starts to sink down into the pool  please help me  she turns around and looks back to him. he continues to sink. his eyes stay open as he begins to float  please\u2026       silence    int. hospital  eyes slowly open. darkness begins to become light. a faint voice is beginning to get louder and louder. the blindness becomes clearer and clearer. a figure begins to manifest itself. a doctor with a thick australian accent comes into view. looking down on a clipboard the doctor ah yes youre awake. good morning mister- the boy w- where am i the doctor the hospital. do you know where you are right now do you have any memory of what happened  the boy tries to remember what happened to him but he seems to be struggling the boy yeah\u2026 i\u2026 i remember going up

the i n ter net    **************      letter from the author: i know that this isnt 300 words. it was really hard to contain myself. we should be free free to let our imaginations explore. free to write our endings the way we want them. as i read over some of the fantastic endings that were written here for this contest it makes me wonder what would it be like if they werent contained to a mere 300 words. because in my opinion... i dont think donald would want us to limit ourselves because he himself hates limits. he hates limiting himself to a rapper or an actor or a comedian. he just wants to make things people want to listen to. that was my goal with this script. something people liked to read. i hope you guys enjoyed reading this half as much as i enjoyed writing it. if you want to eliminate me from the contest i understand. just know that i put every ounce of love and care i had into this project. this wasnt just a half-assed entry for something some people probably wont even care about. no i respect this album and donald too much not to attempt to do it justice. so i wrote. constant sleepless nights countless views of clapping for the wrong reasons endless analysis of the script. i went through constant revising of the script until i thought it was perfect. and this is what came out of it. sure its flawed but its a flaw that im proud of. thank you for your time.                                                         - a boy  "]}
