{"macklemore & ryan lewis": ["  i couldnt escape id been escaping the whole time i had to finally look look at the mess we had made and all thats lacker the glory and tarnished failures stare at it... and then leave  i was too comfortable being comfortable is what kills artists there is creativity for validation and there is creativity for survival theyre very different places i didnt know what i wanted to say didnt know how the ink would stick to the page how to let go of the anxiety and the suffocating fear that latched onto my vocal chords i had to figure out how to use my voice again  so we went ghost the irish goodbye into the woods in the dead of winter we bought a 1985 suburban loaded up our equipment and just left town  people make music for all different reasons its the fabric that connects us we dance together we cry together we celebrate our communities we question our politics we laugh we scream we imagine we live what i couldnt find in a hotel room on the road or even in seattle i found in the middle of nowhere no reception making music not because we had to but because we got to i had forgotten how to do that not being afraid of the platform we were standing on not creating from a place of dont fuck it up but creating from a place of fuck it up  look at the mess not just the one that we created but the one that is the very fabric of our country the mess were all living in stop being silent even if its not perfect or politically correct you have to speak up you have to listen dance cry question everything laugh scream imagine live  music was never intended to be programmed to manufactured and turned into a commodity music was intended to be that one thing that we could rely on to disrupt the norm start conversations and change the way that we think and we feel  if you arent scared of what you created you arent done yet on february 26th i want to share with you this unruly mess ive made  "]}
