{"hopsin": ["  hopsin | knock madness| track-by-track review  anything in italics is directed straight towards hopsin .  this shit is my opinion. keep your own  summary of the review  the fiends are knocking:  actually its one of the best songs on the entire album. i can say i fucks with the hook. the verses are cool. the production isnt what i exactly expected for the intro. i thought i was listening to holy grail when heard them pianos in the beginning  one thing that threw me off on this song is apparently someones dad got off drugs because of hopsins music and im like what the fuck you mean your nose was filled with booga suga until you heard hopsin say otherwise if bankruptcy or death cant keep people from doing drugs hopsin can cmon son  hop is back:  honestly i skipped it only because ive heard the track before but i do that to any album. the biggest talk about this song was the yeezus and kendrick disses. well i felt the same way about yeezus and the kendrick joke was funny to me but i dont think they shouldve been mentioned on the first official single to the album. i think this is what the ill mind 6 shouldve been\u2026but hey its hopsin  whos there feat. dizzy wright & jarren benton:  why the fuck is dizzy wright on this song if it didnt feel like hop put him on here just for the sake of having all of the fv members on the album. he doesnt fit this shit at all. this shouldve been the first song on the album it shouldve been the first single to the album and it shouldnt have had any features on it  i wish hop composed this beat differently. if he started the song off with the production instead the hook it wouldve been better. i also think that the silence after each hit in the hook is unnecessary. and finally the illuminati line hop furreal i couldve sworn that hip-hop was over this illuminati is evil phase. i makes me think you dont do actual research on the shit youre talking about  tears to snow  all of the feels hop. this is one of the songs where i would like to actually have a one on one talk with hopsin and try to insert a feeling of apathy into his personality. this is what makes the songs sentiments so good. it makes me something for hopsin. i want to help this nigga  the hook tho\u2026hopsin i know there are some fans that love you enough to sing this hook for you. wheres that girl from i am raw  rip your heart out feat. tech n9ne  this is the second best song on the entire album. i honestly dont understand the problem when people talk about the ash ketchem line. i thought it was kinda funny the first time i heard it. im glad to hear hop on a song like this because i can say that i cant hear eminem on this type of song  it has this head basher type feel to it. and that tech feature  nollie tre flippin:  here it is the greatest song on knock madness. hopsin do you see how your best song doesnt have you singing on the hook its a rapped hook bro. its also the only song that gives me a west coast feel to it. i could only imagine how nice this song is to the skaters  gimme that money:  i have no problem with hopsin being corny. im corny too. plus ive been in some similar situations so i get where hes coming from. i just feel as tho the execution is too much of a cluster. theres a little too much going on and the up-tempo beat doesnt exactly help either. if hopsin slowed it down it wouldve been a much catchier song  i need help:  overall what i get from this is that hops mind is convoluted as fuck. the song is filled with too many contradictions\u2026he thinks nobody feels his rhymes but then everyone feels hes cool when hes doing it. what he thinks dizzy wright is stealing his shine\u2026nigga thats your fault hes spazzing out on this track telling us that there will be one more album after this and after that hes done. i felt the hook was too forced. i feel like this is filler  hip-hop sinister:  the whole song wouldve been better if hopsin wasnt yelling. one of the many problems with hopsin: he can spit but theres no substance. hes already said that he would feel bad if he makes a song that has no point. this song feels like a slow blood energy potion. the bars are forced as fuck. the multis are just trying too hard. hopsin i know you can do better than this man\u2026that george zimmerman line was too damn long bro. this is the song that jarren benton shouldve been on. he couldve replaced that whole 3rd verse  hopsin you have no room to talk about simple rhymes. your rhymes have been and still are pretty simple. youre too blunt with your shit theres often no type of wit to them  good guys get left behind:  hopsin\u2026youre 28 and still that na\u00efve cmon son. your message is extremely misconstrued. is even good to be a good guy should we all just be a bad guy  the production is ok. i dont really like the track. hopsin has too many i cant stand these bitches; they dont do me right tracks. its something that i dont really need to listen to because im not going through the same thing  bad manners freestyle:  this is filler to me too. all of the times ive tried to defend hopsin by saying that hes not copying eminem hes just highly influenced all of that went out the window when he came with the nun line  however i wish that this is the production that he used for the previous track. this song suffers the same shit that hip hop sinister does. all bars no substance. it would all be ok too the production is mediocre. ive heard a bunch of rap songs with no meaning but the production made up for the lack of subject matter  old friend:  there is a problem with hopsins writing. he puts details in the wrong areas and takes away details from vital areas. why his friend hung out with the guys that got him into meth who his friend is as a person or why did his friend take the drugs; none of it is talked about in the entire song. the song is called old friend but were focused on hopsins feelings for 99% of the record. why did hopsins friend not give a fuck about what his mom said we dont know but the shit we got from this song is that he was there when hop first started rapping  still got love for you:  this song feels really repetitive. its the permutation of good guys get left behind and gimme that money. and just like back on raw\u2026somebodys pregnant hopsin couldve left this song off of the album completely. the production feels like a leftover from a low selling gospel album. hopsin disappoint me with this song. and that hook  hopsin you honestly thought hop madness was shit but you put this on your album  jungle bash feat. swizzz:  hopsins verse is the same ole shit. its nothing special in particular. i appreciate the das efx. im not gonna lie im giggling at this title. when i saw swizzz on the tracklist i was thinking that he was gonna have a pretty satisfying verse but for this hes gave kinda of a lack luster verse. to be honest i can think of a number of hopsin & swizzz joints that he couldve replace this with  lunch time cypher feat. passionate mc & g-mo skee:  as soon as this track came on i stopped. i had to collect myself.  only one word came to my mind... just think of when billy couldnt stop saying destroy us all or when spongebob repeats soiled it. thats what my mind did. i was hysterical after listening to this. after about 20 minutes of a break i turned it back on. i know that hopsin couldve done better than this  hopsin i dont know what high school you went to but niggas dont beat box anymore. they bang on the table or on a hardback book. if you did that this entire song wouldve at least been listenable  dream forever:  i dont understand why this song is so damn depressing. hopsins more of energetic when hes mad at someone than when hes hoping for the love of his dreams. if any song needed someone to sing for hopsin on this hook its this track  whats my purpose:  i wish instead of complaining about humans i wish hopsin suggested some ways to make humans better. i wish hopsin didnt blame america for a racist cop. i wish hopsin i knew who hopsins idols were. i wish this song was shorter. i wish this song was more motivating than emo. i wish he named this song emo because this is the epitome of what being emo is. i wish this song was more introspective instead of accusing  caught in the rain:  hopsin why is this song not named whats my purpose  i dont get why hopsin feels so lonely. where the fuck is dame swizzz dizzy jarren tech jessie his assistant or even bubbles not to mention his family and his skater friends are record labels pressuring fans and women really a bigger part of your life that you cant talk to any of those people and feel reassured  i see the growth youve had since the previous last track on your album. pillow man wanted what youre talking about but now you hate it  "]}
