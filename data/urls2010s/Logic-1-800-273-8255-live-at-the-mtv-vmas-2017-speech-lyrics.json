{"logic": ["  i just want to take a moment right now and thank you all so much for giving me a platform to talk about something that mainstream media doesnt want to talk about. mental health anxiety suicide depression and so much more that i talk about in this album. from racism discrimination sexism domestic violence sexual assault and so much more. i dont give a damn if youre black white or any color in between. i dont care if youre christian youre muslim youre gay youre straight. im here to fight for your equality. because i believe that we are all born equal but we are not treated equally and that is why we must fight. we must fight for the equality of every man woman and child regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation. so i say here and now if you believe in this message and my lessons of peace love and positivity and equality for all then i demand that you rise to your feet and applaud not only for yourselves but for the foundation we are laying for our children  "]}
