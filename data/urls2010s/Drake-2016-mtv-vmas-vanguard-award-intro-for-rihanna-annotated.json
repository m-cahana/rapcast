{"drake": ["  the first time the first time i met robyn fenty was 2005. she was shooting a music video at a restaurant called avacado in toronto the song was pon de replay and the director... and the director of the video was little x. i was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. its hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called work.  today the world knows little x as director x they know me as drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. but eleven years later they still know rihanna as the one and only rihanna.  captivating from day one the iconic being known as rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. for them thats often a peak but for her that was a starting point as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.  when it comes to music she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. when it comes to performances they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... and when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself which is when it gets a little awkward.  whats most impressive isnt the endless list of stats awards and accomplishments. whats most impressive is the person. some artists need to play a character to achieve success some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. she succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does which is being herself.  this woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from barbados surrounded by the same friends speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless its to come and perform at ovo fest. we love the music which can change styles from album to album. we love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. but most of all we love the woman who hasnt changed since day one.  shes someone shes someone ive been in love with since i was 22 years old. shes one of my... shes one of my best friends in the world. all my adult life ive looked up to her even though shes younger than me. shes a living breathing legend in our industry. ladies and gentlemen the recipient of the michael jackson vanguard award for 2016: rihanna.
