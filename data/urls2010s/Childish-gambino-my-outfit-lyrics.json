{"childish gambino": ["  a kid at the oakland deep web tour stop asked me if i would change my clothes once i made a million.  i decided to write this:      i guess i wrote all this to say that my attire is deliberate as much as it isnt.  clothes arent really important.  theyre fun and can accentuate the parts of u or ur personality u want people to notice. i do love and appreciate good well made/ designed clothes. but theyre not necessary. like a lot of things. like art. like us.  thats kinda what makes it special  will u change ur clothes once u reach a million  i spent 1.2 million out of my own pockets on the deep web tour before wordpress came in and helped with the rest.  because this tour is me.  we use clothes to make a statement about ourselves. thats what theyre for.  and my clothes right now are me  "]}
