"", "   what the government is doin amongst our people is downright evil disturbin but not surprisin thats for certain with all of the conflict of propaganda i believe they are simply tryna slander start a civil war within the usa amongst black and white and those alike they are simply pushin us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it they want us to rebel so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails alton sterlings are happenin every day in this country and around the world the scary part boys and girls is most of these stories dont make it to the news and reach mass consciousness it is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement and accomplishment of what we call human rights it is time to rebel better yet raise hell i just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it because this is all part of the governments plan and what they been plottin theyre literally beggin for this to happen so they can kill us off usin uprisin and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion the cancerous foods the chemical warfare economic sufferin is not workin fast enough there are many steps ahead of us and manifestin the future that they want we have to work together not only rattlin them on a physical plane but to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same as black men i think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin us the people our communities and not assistin in destroyin them brutally its time to even the score cause who do we call when the police break the law we are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another but not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other the code words to killin a black man by police is hes got a gun damned if he do damned if he dont damned if he runs or what about them them murderers got it we need solutions you better start plottin now its always been clear that they dont value our lives my people been sufferin way too long and im tired of singin the same old song people actin like this shit isnt happenin its downright wrong justice wont be served by a hashtag and thats the very reason i ask that what are we to do were scattered around with no clue of this ugly truth all we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed time to wake the fuck up and do our own research and not form opinions based on just what weve heard ameri-k-k-k-a is force feedin you lies down your throats with a silver spoon and eventually well all be doomed real real real soon  "]}
