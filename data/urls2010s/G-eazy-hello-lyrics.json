{"g-eazy": ["  late to my own release party man im tore up and im plastered sorta happy i aint blow up any faster now im wishing it would slow up let me capture experiences while i grow up as a bachelor  makin skrilla while im traveling the atlas when it comes to raps they cant touch me like a cactus everything from this point backwards was practice now im making classics and sleeping with an actress  i guess i just wasnt doing what the rest was even if it meant they always used to show me less love now its always shows at the best clubs the best parties best girls and the best drugs  see a deal is what a dummy runs after diy swag bet your business comes faster i started at the floor now im living on tour you appreciate it more when the money comes after  the hard work and dedication it requires my flow is even hotter than the air inside dryers with a match under a&rs chairs making fires tryna cash a check to satisfy my desires  crops taste better when you harvest them yourself they talk a lot but you should be the hardest on yourself and my only advice is take a look inside the mirror stop rapping now if you dont see an artist in yourself  whats the difference between me and you about 5 beats a day for 3 summers on 2 cpus tryna catch a space ship to the moon i know what i been working for is coming so soon  everyday im gettin money burnin good tree life is turning into everything it should be never ever slowing down why would we life is turning into everything it should be  "]}
