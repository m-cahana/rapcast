{"childish gambino": ["  its a wednesday night in l.a. and donald glover is sitting in front of a computer in a room full of friends taking puffs from his pax vaporizer.  he lives up in the hills of silver lake in los angeles. walt disney built his first big studio here in the 1920s and forbes named it americas best hipster neighborhood in 2012. donalds house\u2014a modern structure far up on the winding roads\u2014looks over the busy city but from a calm and quiet vantage point.  its not a party per se; about a dozen people come and go throughout the night even though reaching donalds house can be a struggle. once they make it through the l.a. traffic and find a place to park on the street guests have to walk up hundreds of steep stairs to the back entrance. by the time they make it to the door theyre breathing heavily. donalds been wearing the same shirt all day and short shorts that he says sometimes get mistaken for boxers. hes playing music ranging from bj\u00f6rk to lil durk through large speakers while a projector beams south park onto a huge screen covering half the wall. he asks everyone to let him know if theyve got any requests. an argument breaks out about whos better maxwell or dangelo. donald and company joke about girls and race and life.  with his friends around hes jovial and quick to break into laughter but as the guests begin filing out around 9 oclock donald gets quieter. its hard to tell if hes relaxed bored or high off the vaporizer. he turns off the music and the conversation quickly leads back to something donald talks about a lot: the internet.  coding is a beautiful thing he says. if there is a god he definitely codes. there are fail-safes in the world. thats code. i dont want young black kids to aspire to be rappers or ballers. even lawyers and doctors\u2014those are service positions. i want them to be coders. they can make their own worlds then. they dont need anybody else. i love hearing those kids ideas all these kids on the internet. the excitement of making something thats the spark of god.  donald glover 30 originally came to fame through comedy\u2014first as a sitcom writer then as a stand-up comedian and finally as an actor playing the fan favorite troy on nbcs community. since he was 20 hes also rapped. when he makes music he does it under the name childish gambino. he famously came up with the alias using an online wu-tang clan name generator. given his comedic background and goofy name the reception to childish gambinos music has often been: is this guy kidding  late last year gambino/glover convinced a lot of people that he was dead serious about his music. in october he stopped by siriusxms sway in the morning radio show in midtown manhattan to premiere a track from his forthcoming album because the internet. he hadnt planned to rap that day but sway convinced him to spit a freestyle over drakes pound cake beat. were they his best bars ever thats up for debate. but the performance became a tipping point in gambinos rap career. the pound cake freestyle set rap blogs afire effectively changing the conversation about childish gambino. since that day nobody asks if the acclaimed comics rap career is some kind of joke.  the day before the get-together at his house donald sat on arsenio halls couch\u2014wearing those same short shorts\u2014and explained that rapping is only one of the things he can do. rappers dont want to be rappers he said. theyre usually artists who want to do a bunch of stuff. i dont think any rapper wants to be just a rapper. on that note because the internet is more than just an audio experience. i believe that music has just become advertising for a brand and if that makes music less magical then fuck you he explains. i understand people being like i worked really hard on this song and id like some payment for it. it just needs to be done differently.  in addition to music videos gambinos album is accompanied by a 73-page script which you can read at becausetheinter.net. the screenplay\u2014which opens with a little boy coming home from camp camp happens to be the name of gambinos last album and getting picked up in a limo by his father who happens to be rick ross\u2014also contains soundless visuals designed to be viewed while listening to the album. the prelude to this script is a perplexingly artsy short film released on donalds youtube channel called clapping for the wrong reasons. it all ties together presumably but its up to the audience to figure out how. because the internet may seem like a strange title for a rap album\u2014there was a time when being called an internet rapper was a bad thing\u2014but it makes sense given how much time donald spends thinking about the world wide web and how it affects both our way of looking at life and his way of making art. he seems both acutely aware of and slightly freaked out by the profound changes taking place around us every day. but hes rolling with it.  with the release of his new album donald has used the internet to build a world of his own. in addition to becausetheinter.net hes turned childishgambino.com into a trove of hidden pages and exclusive content including password-protected music videos a meme generator and behind-the-scenes footage. hes also partnered with websites like tumblr and rap genius to connect with fans through live events and q&as making the release of because the internet an event that brings the web to life.  though hes got lots of smart ideas about how to use the internet creatively spend a little time with donald and youll realize there are a lot of irl issues hes still trying to understand.  despite all of his fame hed be the first to admit his insecurities. i look at success like solving a problem he says. i havent figured out humanity or whatever im searching for yet.  on october 14 donald shared seven handwritten notes with his 222000-plus instagram followers. each piece of hotel notepad paper was filled with deeply personal fears. im afraid people hate who i really am he wrote im afraid i hate who i really am. many fans fretted about donalds mental state but he brushes off those concerns: everybody has the same fears. if my letters did anything they proved that everyone kinda feels the same way. im not special. those letters were not special. they were just louder because i have a platform. even so few people articulate such thoughts to their closest friends and family let alone on social media. you have to be real with yourself he says. no one is doing that. people are too concerned with making everything look nice and calm and pretty.  in the last note donald wrote i got really lost last year but i cant be lonely tho. cause were all here. were all stuck here. he referred to a suicide attempt in an interview with noisey this past october but now says its nobodys business. on 3005 the first single from because the internet he raps leave it like cobain/and when im long gone whole crew sing a swan song/cause we all just ticking time bombs. donald rejects the notion that suicide is weak or selfish. its neither. im still here. i obviously still like it here he says getting louder and excited. everybody feels that way. everybody has suicidal thoughts. everybody is on the verge of suicide every day. you could die at any moment you could have a brain aneurysm. born in california and raised in stone mountain ga. donald is the son of jehovahs witness parents. he attended new york universitys tisch school of the arts and got his first big break in 2006 when tina fey gave him a job writing for her show 30 rock. he was literally still living in the nyu dorms fey recalls. and that was a great resource for us. we would turn to him and ask what would a young person say here  she wasnt surprised when he became a rapper. donald comes from a generation that is very confident doing it all she says. they are comfortable being rapper/actor/entrepreneur/fashion designer/sex-tape authors. lots of rappers become actors. why not do it the other way around doing things that way presents some unique challenges\u2014just ask drake or jaden smith. but fey for one doesnt think it matters. i hope donald knows not to give a shit what anyone thinks.  beyond rapping donald is most known for his role as troy on community. earlier this year the shows creator dan harmon confirmed what he called a devastating piece of news: donald would appear in only five of this seasons 24 episodes. fans immediately voiced their disapproval. its funny because on reddit people are like just give us another year on community  donald explains. i get it it gives life structure. you come home every day and abeds in front of you and when troys not there its like where the fuck is my structure i get it. but its time man.  less acting means more time for music through which hes able to connect with fans on a deeper level than he does on tv. i just wanna fit in but nobody was helping me out/they talking hood shit and i aint know what that was about/cause hood shit and black shit is super different he raps on outside one of his songs that addresses race and class from a perspective that isnt typically celebrated in rap. donald embraces his outsider status calling himself a brown recluse on no exit or a silver spoon coon on sweatpants and his pound cake freestyle. growing up in a working-class town and being the only black kid at a sufjan concert as he says in firefly has given donald glover a unique perspective and a distinct vulnerability that listeners appreciate.  even while delivering the heralded pound cake freestyle nine days after posting his notes on instagram gambino flaunted his insecurities. so nerdy but the flow wordy he rapped but he still impressed sway. folks are sleeping on him because they seen him on tv first says the veteran hip-hop dj. they think hes corny or they dont give him a shot. as he continues to evolve hes differentiating himself from the others. he does that thing where he stops rapping and starts talking and then comes back on beat. thats his signature. i like rappers who find ways to differentiate themselves. patterns are all repetitious now\u2014motherfuckers even rhyming the same words.  according to sway the difference between an internet rapper and a real mc is tangibility. internet rappers might move a lot of free downloads but they cant translate irl. gambinos beyond an internet rapper because ive been to his shows and ive seen them sold out he says. while donald claims to not care about record sales his 2011 album camp released on glassnote records sold over 240000 copies he clearly wants to fill arenas not college auditoriums. my music is for everybody he says. its stuff i like but its also accessible. i dont want to be preaching to the choir. you see a lot of these conscious rappers doing that. theyre not gaining new fans theyre just agreeing with people. i want to reach as many people as i possibly can.  one day in late november gambino hosted an afternoon listening session at pan pacific park in l.a.s fairfax district. a couple hundred kids\u2014a multiracial group of teenagers and twentysomethings\u2014gathered to hear because the internet. hed already held impromptu listening sessions like this in new york philadelphia and toronto. a few hours before donald would tweet out a time and place to his million-plus followers and then arrive there with a sound system to play the album and chat with whoever showed up. no one is using the internet to make real stuff happen donald says. when information travels things usually get made. and thats all the internet is. were just now starting to see things come from it.  but todays session doesnt go quite as planned. donalds right-hand man fam\u2014the guy seen sitting next to him by the campfire in clapping for the wrong reasons\u2014picks up a microphone and explains to the audience that they dont have permits so they are going to get right into playing the album before the cops show up. and if police do try to shut the listening down he advises just be cool: act natural.  about a minute into a knocking new song called crawl a fan approaches donald for a picture. within seconds half the audience swarms around him asking questions and sweating him for photos. sitting on a short wall on the outskirts of the park donald calmly greets his fans seeming happy to speak with everyone. while because the internet plays out of a few big speakers an lapd squad car rolls up on the grass. fam heads straight toward the cops stalling them for a few minutes before a second car pulls up. one officer steps forward and announces that the crowd has 15 minutes to disperse before they start handing out citations. while fam disconnects the power donald sticks around to chat augmenting his online outreach with some face-to-face connections. some people take the name because the internet as a joke\u2014a snarky comment that could be the caption to a meme. but to donald its more than that. the internet has shaped the way he views the world the way he relates to people and the way he creates and disseminates his art.  i want to show how the internet affects our lives he says. as much as everyone can find someone on the internet now we still feel lost. i still feel very empty. it makes me feel more lost because nothing that i do is that different. nothing is cool. were kind of alone in the universe. like those instagram notes i shared. we all feel these things but nobodys figured out how to solve them.  the first step may be just talking things out and thats something childish gambino does well. he talks about loneliness relationship issues isolation and a lot of the personal struggles that artists have been talking about for decades. but hes doing it in a new language with the help of emojis and with a self-awareness and acceptance that challenges the norms of hip-hop celebrity culture social media and yes the internet. thats the thing\u2014its not real its curated he says back in his house after everybodys gone home. everything online\u2014even the fucked-up stuff\u2014is curated. its the same thing as going on a first date. the internet is going on a first date over and over and over again. the last thing i want to be is somebody whos like the internet is wrong. i dont believe that he continues. this is how we connect. i love the internet. were the first ones to have to deal with this kind of stuff. our generation is very important because we can still remember shit before the internet. we remember just enough.  more than just remembering donald understands how music and entertainment are changing and what this means for the business hes in. trying to make somebody pay for music is like a bakery trying to get people to pay for smelling the bread as they walk by he says. this is the way information works now and i dont know if thats good or bad. theres another way to capture that feeling in a more succinct faster fashion. thats what the internet does with everything. so how do you package that  over the past months donald\u2014who recently took up surfing the ocean not the web as a hobby and sometimes wears a wetsuit\u2014has been using the phrase roscoes wetsuit on twitter and instagram. nobody really knows what it means. his fans make up meanings spread rumors and google arduously for clues\u2014nothing. in the screenplay that goes with gambinos album the phrase came up again in a random tweet. the lead character searches for its meaning throughout the story but nobody can help him. so does roscoes wetsuit mean anything is it just a symbol for the meaning were all searching for and failing to find why does roscoes wetsuit even exist in the first place it exists because the internet of course. but ultimately it exists because donald glover created it. and now chicken and futility a short film written by directed by and starring childish gambino.
