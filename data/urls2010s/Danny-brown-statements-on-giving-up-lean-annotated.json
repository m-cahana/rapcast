{"danny brown": [" drinking two-liters of soda you know shitting on myself everywhere. you trying to bring lean to africa with you. just cause you dont want to get sick.  tim westwood: so you have to travel with some lean  danny brown: all the time last time i was with you i was drinking lean remember  tim westwood: how do you travel with quantities of lean  danny brown: because you can take three ounces of liquid on a plane. you know you can buy those travel things just put three ounces in there. it could be shampoo they dont know what it is and if they do find it its my cough syrup. i had a big bottle i had to break -  tim westwood: just break it out-  danny brown: and get through. but then you aint out there drinking to be drinking you out there to get your stomach right.  tim westwood: maintain and self-medicate.  danny brown: its nasty though. so dont drink lean kids dont drink lean.  tim westwood: so you think lean should go down the sink  danny brown: yes. i dont think it should be a drug thats glorified. its liquid heroin its an opiate.  tim westwood: nothing glamorous man.  danny brown: i mean it tastes amazing to have your brain go back to that it tastes amazing. but once you get addicted to that taste man its just a brain thing its like a mental thing youre just stuck there. i havent been drunk in a month month-and-a-half and not a day goes by that i dont taste it in my mouth.  tim westwood: are you feeling it is taking a lot of effort and self-control and self-will and discipline ", "", "  tim westwood: now youve given up the syrup why is- the syrup down the sink. whys that  danny brown: i was getting too fat man i gained like fifteen pounds.  tim westwood: for real  danny brown: yeah i like wearing balmain jeans and rick owens t-shirts. you cant wear rick owens looking pregnant you know what im saying you cant have the gucci mane belly man to wear high-end fashion you know what im saying so one of em had to go.  tim westwood: yeah yeah and for real i mean gucci brought that little fucking belly into fashion uh why he continued it the -  danny brown: you know that look cool when you wear coogi t-shirts and stuff but once you start putting on -  tim westwood: tight shit then you look like a skinny little fat guy.  danny brown: yes and its the worst.  tim westwood: so why was syrup making you fat  danny brown: its the sugar youre drinking a lot of sugar. i might drink a 2-liter of soda a day by myself. thats just too much soda to be drinking a day.  tim westwood: coming off the syrup how long did you feel it took to get your mind off of it  danny brown: about two weeks. i mean your stomach is just real fucked up. thats whats so nasty about it everyones talking about sipping syrup but if you dont have syrup for three days your might shit on yourself.  tim westwood: oh its that bad  danny brown: you cant hold it. its diarrhea. but then this is the other side is if you drink too much you become constipated and you cant take a shit. thats why gucci manes belly was like that it wasnt that he was fat its that he was bloated. there was mad turds up in there.  tim westwood: he was backed up  danny brown: this is true though. so its nasty to all the kids who think drinking syrup is cool dont get me wrong it tastes amazing and it might help you sleep at night but all the other side effects its not worth it.  tim westwood: so the bloated stomach putting on the weight being backed up like a mother fucker-  danny brown: and then if you dont have it you gotta shit like crazy. you cant hold anything. you might as well get some imodium a-d and keep them in your pocket like peppermints. literally as soon as you start eating. you might not even have nothing in your stomach just a couple drops of water. a lot of people listening think its like a glamorous thing its not man  tim westwood: i cant even imagine if i were gonna come off the syrup id be scared to fart.  danny brown: but thats why people continue to drink. and then you have some people that drink all the time and talk about it but you dont see the signs of that. so i think theres a lot of punks i think theres a lot of studio sipping.  tim westwood: you think so  danny brown: they talk about but they aint about it.  tim westwood: they aint about it.  danny brown: yeah. they just promoting it. at the end of the day yeah it is for no reason.  tim westwood: with that sleeping is good though  danny brown: yeah and it was good for me to sleep youre traveling to different time zones youd just be messed up and then you have to go back out. so to go home and sleep for two days that would be great for me.  tim westwood: thats how crazy it is you just sleep for hours  danny brown: yeah i would probably sleep like ten hours. just out real deep sleep. you dont even know you sleep. thats the thing thats why a lot of people die in they sleep because of some habit while you sleep. if something weird were to happen while you sleep and you cant take care of it.  tim westwood: and sometimes man you just shut down in your sleep everything just shuts down.  danny brown: now i just take a xanax man.   danny brown: i think its just helping me because im gone. if i was home id be around people who drink.  tim westwood: so the road is your rehab. but do you think that you could slip back in two years time  danny brown: no i dont even want to think like that no. its not something you can do soci- its not something you can do recreationally. one sip and you back. its like smoking crack or something. its nothing you can play around with be like let me taste your cup.  tim westwood: i used to smoke a spliff every day smoke a spliff in the morning and now i only smoke once a week.  danny brown: once you sip you drink it all day every day. like i say man its  a liquid form of heroin with you. everybody know what heroin do to people.  tim westwood: well i want to wish you good luck with that. you had some low moments. what were those moments like feeling like  danny brown: ive been drinking that shit for the last two years. anybody whos been dependent on something for that long youll have emotional issues. as long as im not at home ill be fine.  tim westwood: now you tweeted out during the low moments. do you feel like that was a cry for help saying youre going through a hard time  danny brown: no that was just one of those things that i probably couldve kept to myself. twitter is a motherfucker sometimes. sometimes your battery just needs to die. but you know im the type of person that wears my heart on my sleeve. i dont live for nobody but me.  tim westwood: what i understand is that there was not enough people reaching out to you. not fans but other artists there were no artists who were reaching out to you.  danny brown: no i was just in my feelings you know at the end of the day it was just me getting off drugs and being emotional and being in my feelings. i was just feeling a type of way that day. im over it now. everybody that i felt like i cared about that i do care about that cares about me they reached out to me. they saw that shit like what the fuck are you talking about i was just tripping man.  tim westwood: was the asap mob there for you  danny brown: rocky was actually trying to call me but i didnt know it was his number so i didnt pick up so i missed out on rocky. chase talked to me though.  tim westwood: hes good people. so i wish you the best of luck on your journey man.  danny brown: thank you. im still out there having fun you know  "]}
