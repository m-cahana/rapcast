{"chance the rapper": ["  does it feel like an eternity since acid rap it feels way shorter. every day is a workday. its hard to explain. when youre working on shit every day and it comes back full circle three months later it doesnt hit you the same way. cause its something i knew i was working on.  can you gauge your increasing fame definitely. i do recognize it all the time. but its not like . . . i dont necessarily feed into the whole newfound-fame type shit or feeling like a different person. if anything it makes me realize how fleeting and unreal it all is. its all just about perspective. i just feel like its not real. its real but only in the way it affects those around you. fame or perceived success \u2013 it all comes from groupthink.  ...  have you thought about signing with a label theres no reason to. its a dead industry.    is it also because you like maintaining direct control over your career i dont really have control over my direct impression on people anymore. i used to be the person putting my cd in peoples hands. but im kind of a mainstream artist now. not by choice. not by what i make or anything. but just by that ripple-effect shit.    when will we get an acid rap follow-up the whole point of acid rap was just to ask people a question: does the music business side of this dictate what type of project this is if its all original music and its got this much emotion around it and it connects this way with this many people is it a mixtape whats an album these days anyways cause i didnt sell it does that mean its not an official release so i might not ever drop a for-sale project. maybe ill just make my money touring.
