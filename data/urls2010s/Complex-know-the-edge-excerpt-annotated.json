{"childish gambino": [" i get it it gives life structure. you come home every day and abeds in front of you and when troys not there its like where the fuck is my structure i get it. but its time man.", "  even while delivering the heralded pound cake freestyle nine days after posting his notes on instagram gambino flaunted his insecurities. so nerdy but the flow wordy he rapped but he still impressed sway. folks are sleeping on him because they seen him on tv first says the veteran hip-hop dj. they think hes corny or they dont give him a shot. as he continues to evolve hes differentiating himself from the others. he does that thing where he stops rapping and starts talking and then comes back on beat. thats his signature. i like rappers who find ways to differentiate themselves. patterns are all repetitious now\u2014motherfuckers even rhyming the same words.  according to sway the difference between an internet rapper and a real mc is tangibility. internet rappers might move a lot of free downloads but they cant translate irl. gambinos beyond an internet rapper because ive been to his shows and ive seen them sold out he says. while donald claims to not care about record sales his 2011 album camp released on glassnote records sold over 240000 copies he clearly wants to fill arenas not college auditoriums. my music is for everybody he says. its stuff i like but its also accessible. i dont want to be preaching to the choir. you see a lot of these conscious rappers doing that. theyre not gaining new fans theyre just agreeing with people. i want to reach as many people as i possibly can. ", "", "    some people take the name because the internet as a joke \u2014 a snarky comment that could be the caption to a meme. but to donald its more than that. the internet has shaped the way he views the world the way he relates to people and the way he creates and disseminates his art.  i want to show how the internet affects our lives he says. as much as everyone can find someone on the internet now we still feel lost. i still feel very empty. it makes me feel more lost because nothing that i do is that different. nothing is cool. were kind of alone in the universe. like those instagram notes i shared. we all feel these things but nobodys figured out how to solve them.
