misunderstanding she only did it to get her way so he cant visit his kid when she has the baby officer what kind of mother in their right mind would ever wanna hide a fathers face that wants to be right beside em waitin to look in his sons eyes when hes born just to see him layin in another mans hands that wasnt even fuckin made for em huh i just dont understand nobody in this bitch can tell me that this shit wasnt fuckin planned the only reason im in sydney is to perform cause i was flown in by an old homie dan he said he holds the ropes of a dope marketing plan and said he could throw me up on a whole stage with a brand cause ive been broke hoping to get my family the fuck out of the hoods dump that we stuck growin in so i was ready to open up with some shows to promote my motherfuckin jams but everything i was stoked for got put on hold thrown down the hole all because his schedule got crammed there i am still standin in the hotel pocketin keys while reachin for my phone it was cold fingers froze i could barely fuckin think i didnt know if i was gonna be stranded with no place for me to go  then out of no where dan approached  me with sleeves bigger than his arms inside of his coat throwing up his hands with peace signs like ayo fuck that all i could think was how could i blow up your phone for so long just to receive a stone cold shoulder and only say shit when you see me despite me but i almost let loose and broke through every single fuckin row of his god damn teeth man fuck hows he gonna treat me like this i even gave his ass a place to sleep i even put food on a plate to eat i about hit him but it wasnt like me to fight a homie that ive known since i was 19 but why would he fly me out to not fuckin ride with me all of this shit he started to spill was feelin fishy i couldnt help but feel it was a payback of some sort that i was missing  we step inside his room right he said i get you need this promo but that may have to wait as i got a lot on my plate with this fuckin trainin shit thats why i havent opened you a spot yet and i was like wait what he said yeah i got a lot of clients that im busy with thats why ive been stayin in this hotel a bit but im a get you your plane ticket get you back to your state dont worry bout that shit. i was pissed. so i flipped his table picked it back up and launched that shit bitch what you mean

aint got no money in a fuckin bank account  he said bro i didnt think it would turn out the way they did.. im a personal trainer now i get busy with shit calm down nah fuck you this whole time i been tryin to get on and you leave me out cause you busy gettin people in shape bitch officer it didnt make any sense why would he fuck me over like that man  i aint think anything of the shit i pushed him out my face thinkin through the action i was about to make my brain was racing i just wanted to break his face so before i made a mistake i took a step and walked away tryin to think of clever shit to say but couldnt all on my mind was i wanted to load a gun and take away his life today i couldnt fathom all the pain in my chest i couldnt breathe was going insane need to take a seat and rest i was like you know what aight fuck you i dont even need those mofuckin venues i dont need any fliars or mofuckin menu i dont need to be put on by a fuckin liar like you especially the one i help give my fuckin life to i went to leave before i stormed the door i told him listen bitch i need cash a plane ticket a way to pay these stores and im not fuckin playin anymore  about an hour went by i was gatherin my shit i keep callin and callin he kept stallin n shit i texted him a message it was never read after i sent no reply so fuck it i decided to visit ill be damned if this cocksucker thinks we are finished i arrived at his door after 15 minutes hear a strange noise coming from with in it door was unlocked i didnt give a fuck i opened it and barged right in it started hollerin yo where the fuck you at all i seen was him and a girl covered up in the bed the girl who was layin up beside his head peaked out i freaked out is that a-alyce what the fuck she jumped up i pulled my phone out
