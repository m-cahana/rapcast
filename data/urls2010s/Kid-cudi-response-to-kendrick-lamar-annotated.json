{"kid cudi": ["   people keep asking me how i feel about kendricks verse on big seans jams. it was dope  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013  ur suppose to want to bite the heads of ur opponents. hip hop aint about hugs and high fives.  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013  i personally dont think anyone should have responded. niggas need to put that energy into makin a classic album and responding that way.  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013  id feel this way had he mentioned me or not. cuz at the end of the day kendrick showed love was polite and really genuine when we worked  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013 and thats what matters.  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013  every rapper should want to murder other rappers. its a joke otherwise  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013  im just happy i lost the most emo rapper award recently ha  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013 to everyone who felt some type of way by kendricks verse ha  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013 its rap. niggas aint saving lives or feeding the hungry. who caresses  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013 ok so those are my thoughts  \u2014 scott mescudi @ducidni august 15 2013   "]}
