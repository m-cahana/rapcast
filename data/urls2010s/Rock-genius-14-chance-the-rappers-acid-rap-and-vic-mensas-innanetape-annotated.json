{"chance the rapper": ["", "    yeah we listen to hip-hop at rock genius too my people especially when it hits this hard. gotta admit rap genius is the sole reason i was exposed to both of these game-changing artists. i remember the first time i heard chances favorite song w/ childish gambino and how hyped it got me. i remember the first time i heard the bass drop on vics yap yap and how i bounce like a crazy asshole every time i hear it play. but what stokes this old school hip-hopper the most about these records is that its a glimpse into the future of hip-hop. with these two talented and independent mcs from chicagos savemoney crew leading the charge chance the rapper   lets start with chance. the beauty of acid rap is that theres so many different tracks that have imminent appeal to different sets of ears that all it takes is to connect with one of them before being sucked in to the entire composition. chance put the mixtape up on his website as a free download in true independent artist fashion and has been touring the country and world with reckless abandon ever since. what sets him apart is the emotional nature of his songs. hes silly at times zany on others but in the end his ability to dig deep inside and feel and convey his and your emotions is sublime so dance for daddy like gator aint no partners on this trip and lose yourself in my room and find yourself in my griphe has a slew of these heartening moments and hes more than just a lover on the record. he breaks through the chaos of social injustice in inner city chicago to call attention to black/white issues on paranoia:  they murking kids they murder kids here why you think they dont talk about it they deserted us here where the fuck is matt lauer at somebody get katie couric in here probably scared of all the refugees look like we had a fucking hurricane here they be shooting whether its dark or not i mean the days is pretty dark a lot down here its easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot the point here is that chance is a socially conscious dude and he knows how to hit home with whats on his mind. but hes also balanced and knows how to bring our spirits back up. make no mistake about it at its core acid rap is a lot about drugs. namely how these experiences have shaped his style and his mind in many ways. and chance the jokester rears his head on smoke again: flip the candy yum thats the fucking bombest lean all on the square thats a fuckin rhombus again on juice when he spouts the line that everyone likes to go around mimicking: i got the juice juice juice juice juice. theres a sticky quality to his flow. you wanna go around repeating em. you wanna chuckle when you think about missing cocoa butter kisses. and this is the sign of a dude whos in control...one whos leading a chicago crew making a lot of noise. but before i bring it all back home theres another dude whos also the focus of this post vic mensa   man...its kinda crazy to think that both of these dudes who put out the hottest independent hip-hop shit of the year are from the same city and the same crew. while theres a ton of similarities: indie status some common producers collabos and the black lipped bastard himself its the difference in their styles that make them a unified force  where chance can appeal to our soft spots on innanetape vic comes to getcha from the start. orange soda opens up with a fiery hook and you know that dude means business: to get you what you need make you love it make you want it cause baby you are so amazingthis is shit that transcends our conventional notion of hip-hop. theres an aura that vic projects that he manages to reign in with the producers he works with. hes so comfortable in the beat and he plays with well others despite always stealing the show. just listen to him and english singer eliza doolittle bouncing back and forth on ynsp. droppin bombs like: aint shit change but everythang wonder how i stay afloat when the pressure on my name could probably make a levee sinki laugh at how fluent his flow is. this is some top dog shit right here. like on the church choir inspired beat produced by the venerable hit boy on innanetapes closing track we see vics intensity. the same intensity he flashes on the hook for time is money: make money but the money you make dont make you make money but the money you make dont make you make money but the money you make dont make youthats some real shit right there. being an underground dude this appeases a lot my direction of hip-hop qualms for sure. he keeps his head about him and i just wanna hear more of it. dude is collaborationg across the board and is even tabbed to tour with disclosure in 2014. swoon  two heads are better than one  ill admit it...originally the idea for this post was to just be about chance. ive spent a lot more time with acid rap this year largely because it came out first. but the point i wanna drive home here is that together chance and vic are unstoppable. a homie texted me last night said vic came out on stage during chances hometown show and they killed it. theres so much energy coming from chicago right now on the strength of these two cats. its fucking beautiful. its what i want out of hip-hop today. its chance & vic recognizing that versatility is the future  mark my words when hip-hop starts consistently crossing over into collaborations with electronica and rock artists its gonna change the game. chance the rapper & vic mensa are traditional mcs at their core but they get the potential for this future of hip-hop and when i look into a crystal ball i see them ___________________________________________________________________________________________  to listen to any of the albums on our
