{"j. cole": ["  chorus the good days are gone i fucked up i coulda been someone... rivercity was us i got nuthin but love for my crew its still my city no matter where i move and though the well done run dry i fill my cup; cuz im still someone... rivercity was us i got nuthin but love for my crew its still my city no matter what ohhh  verse 1 i was nobody prior to rap pliable - liable to act prideful when i was in fact trying to hide from my past rivals i lied to myself 13: punk rock was my end-all no genre compared; barbie without a ken doll dead kennedys/minor threat/ramones/rancid i loved the misifts - but only with glenn danzig black flag; and who could forget the sex pistols subscribed to hit parader read every fresh issue i never guessed what id least expect to get into would nest in me dressed to impress and press into my flesh and sinew... turns out not all hip-hops less than simple: it can be complex and sinful lets continue... june of 01 i met colmes and we became best bros he showed me the light showed me the mic... showed me how to hone what i write and transform my foreign form from my former device into more than a bored chorus four-score from the mic from a spore that absorbs orbs for supportin new life and before this i felt sure rap was a horrible type of abnormal recital like a sort of porno you write like a form of informal advice a portal to forewarn mormons and all men alike of the force in the night... colmes schooled me on a few thangs first lesson was wu-tang second lesson: learn the new slang ebonics by big l was a big help... third lesson was all culture; the four elements how to tell homies from vultures he told me that real rappers are freestylers so meanwhile just practice for adversaries unwraveling capilleries adamant-actin adapting to habitats is scary and very combative so stack up a mad vocabulary he introduced me to jarrod thomas from barkers point back then he was klassick he asked if i wanna spark a joint years later names changed and monark had joined our crew; called ourselves e-sential the hardest boyz reppin the north side... sabotage on my tail but jarrod was barely involved in the songs that we spilled cuz he was also a member of ill logic as well; at first i came across as a novice with obvious help i dont think he really thought a lot of me til i recorded my song criminology and well... i could tell he noticed a spark in me: cracka can rhyme that was at 16 big dreams back of the line remember when we met swollen members and project wyze tannery full of buses...fans fussin in line moka tried to get us inside the upper deck but we was underage so we stayed on their bus eatin chips prevail was real but mad child was a dick moka only was our homie gave us heineken sips jelleestone and the rascalz... gettin high with the gods k-os was the bomb and kardinal offishall... freestylin with everything tryna make an impression so these celebrity legends always remembered fredericton i still got the photos...me dressed like im dead i wanted ecko that xmas: i got exco instead writing words on the paper til nothings left in my head... new semester attending fhs with no friends it was here i met kaleb; he took all the attention asking people where can i find a good quality kitten i just thought he was kiddin later on i witnessed him at the mall flittin along and his collar was twitchin: it was a small little furball squallin relentless he said nobodyd be bitchin if we all had a kitten... yeah i saw he was different: fairly gregarious spare me the alias of this australian alien scared the episcopalians failing the processors lepers with hot peppers a leopard to spot-checkers hip-hop is chess not checkers; poison every emcee i bodied casper live on 95.7 the beat i was never this free; sparrin mano-e-mano juliano the godfather corrado soprano fredericton was the scene freddy beach was too shitty; we needed a name with a dream; someone said rivercity we was young we was kingz... so we started a crew by 05 we was comprised of like 1-dozen dudes: nemesis juliano monark tubby d symphintry kc...great dane rip talksick and envy: gorilla militants skillfully spillin millions of syllables full of sillyness heinous speech entertainers j-names rolling deep rolling dangerous; jeremy jody jarrod and jason jeff justin josh joey jed and then jacob just a justification for jumbled alliteration it seemed that figures of speech were a way to our dreams... save the day and then fade away with a bag fulla weed rivercity kingz: what a great name for the team stake claims to break waves with our ways and our means fake life-wreckers; remember late nite records twenty4seven brakelights make life hectic in 05 i could repay the biscuits rap battles at the dj olympics we played to win then phakt repayed the interest ima decay these bitches; first victim i iced this rich kid with a mic some lil bitch named white seventeen and supreme makin dreams out of reams churnin cream in our teens we freezed knees in capris medellin never been... ied: smithereens - like fedeyeen for marines freddys breezy for sheez now my talents surpassin: student schoolin his master all on my own anglophone /slash/ microphone grasper that was back when we ate mushrooms in jarrods attic and i gotcha back by monark & symph hadnt been scrapped yet and they aint scrapped yet; still best homies from knee-high til joey and jarrods woman toni boned it was peacetime there just never had been a time when they never was friends now its 2017 and still: never again light a candle for mikey... light a candle for branscombe... leeferd jammin on his left-handed banjo at random tubby d and d-zel out scramblin fences ramblin breakin n enterin scammin n fencin goddammit when i said it i meant it; we was family rivercity calamity: damage relentless you know me was 03 life is war was 04 north side was 05... ...then a whole lotta more every fredericton venue i performed at em all the tannery the playhouse sweetwaters for sure wednesdays at the cap; nicky zees 20/20... leo hayes at the caf - stole every show like its money student union from students at unb and stu to the truly stupid duffuses who used to be me now theyre you terry thomas/apaustrophe is now called nfp; socially exceptable - thats him partnered with ceeb rockin apocalypse-causing jaw-dropping releases so fiber-optic only the top optometrists see them the elks club: bonshah be demolishing beats droppin bombs on the strong righting wrongs for the weak loc helped us record songs for our lp but we abandoned it way before we could master the bastard.. but we did a few shows... mostly i improvised; red as drunk as a skunk me as high as the sky free lines from the guys: e coke or whatever; sniff it smoke it i aint jokin i was hopeless as ever music dropped into second drugs hopped into 1st place in the past decade i might recall one or two birthdays what the fuck can i say... best days of my life but now theyre gone cuz im dead: bring me into the light  chorus the good days are gone i fucked up i coulda been someone... rivercity was us i got nuthin but love for my crew its still my city no matter where i move and though the well done run dry i fill my cup; cuz im still someone... rivercity was us i got nuthin but love for my crew its still my city no matter what ohhh  "]}
