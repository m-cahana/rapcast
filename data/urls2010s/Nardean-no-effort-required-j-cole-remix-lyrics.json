{"j. cole": ["  verse 1:  i dont write my future i read it crystal ball leading me through the fire actions inspired no effort required i always get what im needing never what im wanting i only block whats in front of me when i start fronting so i dont go running i dont go hunting i just stand my ground i see the deer in the distance and trust that its coming cause what i seek is seeking me eventually is an illusion theres no need to be pursuing i read it like a student  i been studying these laws i am both effect and cause im the one who makes the calls everything i want its mine its mine  hook:  its yours its yours its yours its mine its mine  everything i want its yours its yours its mine  verse 2:  im breaking all the rules i wont stay stagnant im on the move i stay in tune yeah im bringing the flows the season monsoon yeah got nothing to prove yeah yeah man i just got groove yeah yeah i got that juice yeah yeah yeah   they called me queen nardean i never once did ask them they just felt the energy when i walked past them its like magic those hogwarts tests i passed them using words as spells so like nets we cast them i think we could make a new mould use these lyrics as plaster   theres no start no end nothing to mend each crack you think you have is there to let you breathe my darling you are already there outlined by god the lines they are sharp like edges of glass im catching the shards so i can be a reflection of yours im blessed with a cause not flexing for more or settling scores im a flicker and a filament like sunshine its warm when you feeling it your prayers im hearing em through dimensions im steering them cheering them forwards and onwards and present electric were charged up magnetic so read what is written decode the records with intuition the path it does know you the omens will show you everythings abundant nothing is redundant everything you want its yours   hook:  its yours its yours its yours its mine its mine  everything i want its yours its yours its mine  i dont really mind everything i want yours its yours its yours its mine its mine \u2764\ufe0f  "]}
