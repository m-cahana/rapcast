most difficult things that we face. but change is inevitable. one reason we dont like change is we get comfortable where we are. we get used to our friends our job the place we live. and even if its not perfect we accept it because its familiar. and what happens is because were not willing to change we get stuck in what god used to do instead of moving forward into what god is about to do. just because gods blessed you where you are doesnt mean you can just sit back and settle there. you have to stay open to what god is doing now. what worked five years ago may not work today. if youre going to be successful you have to be willing to change. every blessing is not supposed to be permanent every provision is not supposed to last forever. we should constantly evaluate our friendships. whos speaking into your life who are you depending on make sure theyre not dragging you down limiting you from blossoming. everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever. if you dont get rid of the wrong friends you will never meet the right friends.
