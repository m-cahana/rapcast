{"mac miller": ["  i know that it is freezing but i think we have to walk waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off but julie knows a party at some actors west side loft supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning theyll be gone  when everything is lonely i can be my own best friend i get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations with the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection the mask i polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit  and i know you have a heavy heart; i can feel it when we kiss so many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it but me im not a gamble you can count on me to split the love i sell you in the evening by the morning wont exist  youre looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black you just keep going to the bathroom always say youll be right back well it takes one to know one kid i think youve got it bad but whats so easy in the evening by the morning is such a drag  ive got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train if you promise to stay conscious i will try and do the same we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain but what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane  and im not sure what the trouble was that started all of this the reasons all have run away but the feeling never did its not something i would recommend but it is one way to live cause what is simple in the moonlight by the morning never is whats so simple in the moonlight now is so complicated whats so simple in the moonlight so simple in the moonlight  "]}
