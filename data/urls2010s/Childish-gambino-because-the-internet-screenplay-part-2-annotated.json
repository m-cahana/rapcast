awwww  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0man in suit contd: and now the traditional march to forever to bless the bride and groom with happiness for all their days to come  everyone claps  *******", "*******  ", "  little creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. some have banners that say happy marriage. some have sparklers. they all bounce on beat. its cute for a very short moment. then it feels wrong  all the creatures have two legs two arms like humans.  but they are definitely not humans. one of the giveaways being that they are naked but dont seem to have genitals  all the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths their noses being two tiny slits probably dont allow for heavy air traffic  theyre about three feet high. their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces. they dont have hair anywhere on their bodies. they all have forced smiles on their faces. you can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile. insinuating carnivorous behavior. if they wanted to at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in .8 seconds. but theyre not right now. theyre marching one of the creatures has tears in its eyes. still smiling tho. pushing the smile  everyone is smiling as they march past but theyre all very cautious. clearly worried that one may attack. the boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle. they do this weird clapping almost step team routine then stop. the music stops  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0creature 1: we did it  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0creature 2: yay  everyone claps. the bride and groom force a smile. the creatures slowly make their way back to the kitchen. all thats heard is their struggled breathing and clammy skin hitting the wooden dance floor. one stares at the boy as he or she leaves  ...that was unacceptable.
