{"yelawolf": [" so i had a phone call with a good friend of mine the other night and um seems that ive created some confusion he told me straight up people dont know you like i do man i guess i havent said enough or maybe ive said too much i dont know but i dont wanna leave any stone unturned or no questions about who i am or what i represent so here you go\u2026  ", " i grew up in the deep gutter raised by wolves church steeples and a single white mother taught to be blind to any colour by hippies who been smoking weed since the 60s with dukes of hazzard for bed covers rocknroll country music and cocaine one hand on the bible and the ouija board in the other the irony of it all is so thick that a fly would get stuck in the thin air of that dope smoke lynyrd skynyrd and michael jackson practicing moonwalking with a broomstick in the kitchen popping and locking no bet on television we didnt have it we had the rabbits the tin foil mason jar on the counter full of bacon oil now looking back talking bout freedom yeah you were spoiled oblivious to the hideous crimes from the insidious minds that took place right below us on the southern soil the blood and the pain left a recoil the creekwaters holding secrets ghosts of confederate veterans in the wind backwoods are haunted with the death and the sin slave ships carried the lost souls wicked white men slaughtering angels for a fucking bar code we buried these wicked ways the world is still turning and these motherfuckers with they crosses is still burning yeah i seen em at the courthouse not really sure what theyre trying to prove still jumped up on mountains theyre still trying to move hills and their daughters probably listen to dru hill pussy hotter than blue steel for dru hill so jesus come take the wheel no you steer drunk the youth herere punks the truth here it come ill show you how these country folks pop that trunk uh and my honesty is modest to tell the whole truth yeah ive pondered and ive pondered to be spit at and called a wigger from who you considered a father at 14 ll make you wonder and you wonder yeah thats hard to hear aint it but at that very moment my picture got painted call it god call it what you will but i knew the south was sick still and in need of some changes so i took it upon myself to adopt all the outcasts i took the american and the confederate flag threw it in my back pocket i even went and got tatts and carried them like a shield for the shit that once held me back and these redneck brothers of mine playin that 3.6 in a fucking cornfield in big trucks with lift kits oblivious to the beauty of juxtaposition they had no idea how special it was to witness them in deep alabama playing snoop and group home big hank and metallica i discovered a new zone and catfish billy a way for me to talk about it from them on i was questioned and highly doubted by my peers who didnt understand that all these years wed been the brunt of the jokes america made it clear that we were backwards wrong behind and segregated so i decided that yelawolf would go make it more obvious that weve grown i polished up my tone i signed to shady and brought a record deal home look mama no hands im coming up yeah im grown respect from the ogs cosigning my songs first it was bun b then raekwon and tip then all of these mcs wanted features from me but i was a live wire my tongue was a fuckin blade to these critics who didnt get it the clips from the grenade in my teeth a little too unique the market for me was smaller than some thought it would be even me so i looked in the mirror saw the jordans the gold chain my shirt\u2014pantera rebel flag in my pocket red tattooed on my neck heart of dixie across the stomach and it aint clicked yet maybe i wore the wrong shoes back to the woods because these suede no. 5s cant get wet maybe its something i need to go figure out on my own so after radioactive i took my shit back home disappeared from the world became increasingly different tuned in every once in a while to see who was spitting but mainly i was in nashville getting back to my roots explorin music with love story i made it my truth dropped a single called til its gone and travelled the globe i started seeing rebel flags everywhere at my shows i didnt think nothing of it i assumed that they get it im on some new south shit but i have to admit it i saw the posts up on instagram proclaiming im racist and that im fucked in the head and i dont know where my place is i started taking it personal cause i treat people equal homie i got mixed kids and music is how i feed em lo and behold as im saying this i discover this evil white boy went in a church and killed 9 innocent people goddamn hold on moment of silence  ", "", "   nine innocent church going people get murdered theres not a word i can utter theres not a rhyme i can say there aint no fixing that ever those people brutally slain and i refuse to see ways to justify all the blame that motherfuckers insane i got so mad at my own image i took down merch no explaining it now its only making it worse this fucking coward this criminals just a puppet a mental case but the truth is the truth he did it because of race theres nothing i can describe the shame that i felt inside a white boy with the flag committed this homicide i tried so long to defend the south and yes it was my decision my interviews broke on the internet you can see my vision i never thought myself to be like a politician just a witness to the sickness the kindling was in the bridge and the bricks that i laid to the road that i built from the love and the wisdom im trying to find my way but now im feeling imprisoned from the stereotypes i was prepared for the fight hell ill be stereotyped until my burial site i married a loaded gun when i married this mic aint playing russian roulette aint playing round with my life cause what i cannot lose is the respect that ive gained friendships i cherish fuck the money and fame black american culture is in the thread of my veins its rocknroll till i die im just a rebel in shame yes i apologize for me and anybody with that flag honestly any proud southerner is sad how do you think i feel when i look at my grandad imagining him dead because of that piece of trash i got nephews nieces who need this peace between this but media is fiendish so if you feel like youre above it or beneath it have a logical mind about who your team is and when you look at me dawg dont look at me like another branch off a tree lord i took this shit and balanced it the best that i could try to hold up the wood of americas old see-saw but this aint hee haw with memaw we aint on the cosby show are we bro daddy may give a goodnight kiss but i can promise you this that you aint promised tomorrow i wish i could go back to the innocence i remember my friends with no differences but pigment is relative isnt it maybe by 2050 well be over it big krit i love you homie keep killin shit you inspired this verse i got your back and thats limitless it is what it is we cannot fix all this ignorance slumerican flags up its over im ending this  "]}
