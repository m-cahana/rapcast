born to a black father and a white mother father that wasnt there addicted to crack cocaine alcohol and various other drugs same as his mom way way back so im gonna tell you about that right and im gonna tell you about how all this young boy ever wanted was happiness all he ever wanted was positivity all he ever wanted to do was entertain and this boy went through hell you gotta understand his mother was racist which is crazy cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist like bitch that dont make no sense but it is what it is you know he grew up her callin him a nigger the kids at school callin him a cracker identifying as black looking as white being told what you can or cant be this kid went through everything he went through... he saw narcotics in the household violence murderers drug dealers he was kidnapped there was crazy shit that happened to this kid and he persevered while the whole world said what they said said you wouldnt be shit you aint gon be nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothing and i and he he said fuck that ima persevere and thats why the message is always peace love and positivity see he always saw things from two sides he always saw things from two sides he always knew that the message everybody was born equal regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation he knew that because he saw that take it back take it way back take it way because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated and that did not know and he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know these people that are ignorant that cannot see the bigger picture that must fight and kill and murder each other but once again all he ever wanted to do was spread a message of equality for every man woman and child regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first now imagine this child growing up and seeing the craziest shit being a part of the craziest shit running around with the wrong people running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and and all this because he didnt know he didnt know but he knew deep down in his heart that it wasnt right and he knew that he needed to get away from it now i want you to also imagine that at 17 years old this child okay leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings and then he would then come home to about eight or nine hours of sleep but spend four five six hours of that working on music persevering grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror and pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people just chanting his name hoping that it would happen but the but the but the world said no mothafucka little mothafucka no-no no-no no-no no-no ya nigga ya cracka ya white boy ya black mothafucka no-no take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first and he said fuck that he said peace love and positivity he said equality for all man regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah now i want you to also imagine people telling him that he did not live this life you just a white boy you aint never experienced that shit you from gaithersburg maryland nothing happens there oh no no we know we werent there we didnt live with you we didnt live in your section 8 household we didnt live with the narcotics and violence in your household we just saw it from the outside outside outside outside outside outside outside outside and since you white you gotta have money right take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first black man and this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was wasnt and would never be take it back take it way back take it way way back to the first black and that man is here today proud a lover of all human beings regardless of race religion color creed sexual orientation yeah yeah and hes here to say: even though were all born and created equal we are not treated equally theres extremists on every side and you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe as long as theyre not hurtin anybody you can believe theyre going to hell you can believe its not right you can believe youre superior fine just stop killing each other  "]}
