{"macklemore & ryan lewis": ["  we came in together but you held me the process walking right through that door at the entry i cant seem to remember the lights were so bright and the disco-ball blurred in the turn of that night but it was perfect i was told the tux was starched and all grabbed the glass of punch nervousness struck stood by that wall arms folded myself i didnt know yet until you came over stood by me you poasted you put your hand out like i was stranded tried to pull me on that dance floor.i stepped backwards see i wasnt ready yet but you were my medicine you showed me that trust through that love that you held me with our backs against the wall as the dj would spin the soundtrack had changed as he played that mix our lives flashed in front of us just a glimpse we were together and experience this  you finally pulled me up i didnt want to but you filled me up from the bottom of my heart and as we walked through that gymnasium that id been watching feeling like my chest would explode from my heartbeat to the middle of the floor i almost panicked you put your hand out and i fearfully grabbed it the most beautiful thing that id seen on this planet she laughed cause you could tell that i didnt know how to dance yet we started moving and i didnt know what i was doing you whispered dont you love music its such a gift and ill give it to you but you gotta use it  i strayed she brought me back in trying to sneak a flask outside of that gym she said you dont need that look within she hugged me looked into my eyes she gave me a kiss and she said i cant help you if you dont let me youre here to live just be dont forget me the end of this dance you dont want to regret me live cos tonight youll all be set free  last dance the dj yelled looked into her eyes and i could see myself slow motion frozen toast to this moment like there is no morning like there is no mourning no emotions you on my shoulder me lead and you follow as we circle the floor like the globe through this infinite mass makes us seem so small with you in my hand like the skyline holds the stars not letting go but i cant hold on fading through my fingertips watching us fall i try to catch you with my arms i would never take it for granted when i had you in my palms to all i ever wanted please play my song and put the record to the needle dont ever touch that off switch you are perfect forget that prom dress my god seconds away from god yes somebody turned the heat on in this party or were becoming one because im melting into your body one being heartbeating universe falling the ground split right between us and that concrete separated my love i could hear her calling separated but i could hear her calling goodbye forever never see you again winterball 2012 the end  "]}
