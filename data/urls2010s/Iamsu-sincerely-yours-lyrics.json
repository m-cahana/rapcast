{"iamsu": ["", "   heartbreak terror what the era is never needed a shrink i use my music as my therapist tryna follow the path of the greats minus mistakes cause in life you only get one take you heard me game over lights out hang up your jersey beat the odds like magic cause im so james worthy tangled in this web called fame in this pursuit break free break free its so dangerous to do but its worth it the feeling when words cant break you the feeling when youre actually everything you say you are own songs same swan songs daddy hit mommy mommy left daddy so long granddaddy passed im hugging on granny hold on i aint seen nobody cry in so long i sit back and wonder how everybody is so strong cause i just dont wanna be forgotten i just wanna stack my dough and split the profits with my partners this raps become monotonous going in circles so it forces me to go in early as my curfew in high school yeah i was the but of some jokes with my stress up let it simmer down in the smoke in the war against whack shit im on the front line now im in front the line they cant front on mine everythings by design everythings for a reason now were in the stand theres aint the slightest chance of leaving  "]}
