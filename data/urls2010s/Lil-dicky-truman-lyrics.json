remotely flirtatious i have seen not just one of your pictures i have seen the entire catalog thats the type of shit thats goin down over here right now so... i am definitely ready for that uh next step yknow what im sayin i think its close too i think its close like uh diddy tweeted about me uh yknow that... i dont know if he handles his own twitter i would assume he probably doesnt actually but like im so confident that i feel as though like me and diddy will have a moment just about this outro like when were both sittin next to each other smokin cigars and bein like ay remember when you said that shit on that outro like and im like yeah. thats this is the exact moment i - i did that for yknow what im sayin  ", " bring the - bring the beat back up. i dont know why like keep loop
