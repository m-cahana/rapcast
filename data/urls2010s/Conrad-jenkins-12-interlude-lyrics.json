{"connor": ["  when intuition dies whats left to stand on finally time to face the lies the biggest thing ive ran from in my mind i see my demise im tryna stick to plan one and focus on my words and what my fans want i find serenity when im alone in my own space always swinging for the fences cant get past home plate i know my rhymes are fat like junos belly and i truly dont give a fuck what people tell me im driven internally you know im hungry and im aiming for the stars so if i fall my landings comfy so i 3 peat like carter iii i do my best within my music to give you all a part of me and i aint blowing smoke no swisher sweet cigar with me try testing my flow you failing like geometry to all thats talking down quit bothering me but i always put in work thats my father in me he taught me hard work responsibility so i get it for myself thats the baller in me even if i told you exactly how i saw me the good the bad the ugly like an eastwood story you wouldnt know the half of it you wouldnt know the half you wouldnt know the half of it so get the fuck back  ", "", "    this is a song for all my people whove been down who struggle to lift their smiles when they frown to all my ladies who be crying because they know they really been around to all my dogs with their heads up in the clouds or maybe in the ground all my homies be gunning for the crown this life can be relentless pick you up toss you around just get up and look that motherfucker right in the sclera and never give up you can bear it and in the end no one really gives a fuck about what youre wearing the only thing that matters is how much youre really caring i care about my impact on this entertainment and keeping up my virtues i could use some help with patience and everybody has a purpose youre not brainless im tryna help you out so you can focus on the pain less so if youre faced with stainless you can shine your light and itll rain less and we can stray away from getting caught up in arraignments and crash and plummet stand up for something and take it to the max summit i never bum it you wouldnt know huh cause you dont know the half of it  "]}
