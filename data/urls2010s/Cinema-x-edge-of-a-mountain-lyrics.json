{"earl sweatshirt": ["  {intro} *cough cough* x yeah x  {verse: cinema x} im sometimes ignorant to my own visions my intentions and wont listen to own living i can speak on topics but already written down seek truth but how the hell is you sittin down i try not to seem like im preaching but affirmative is the only way that im reaching em or maybe not maybe im just speeding to conclusions and teach the wrong thing i needed to catch myself before my fans become routers and leave me hanging from a root not a flower we all fall into our own quest for power some fail some succeed get to top floor of tower all begin at the bottom crawl to top for hours but die of exhaustion at the summit call it power fly across the sky but really always running in place of lost and never accomplish nothing say it double negative did i actually spit something or just wasted time i call that technique trumping at the pinnacle of a mountain we will all sit who stays exactly how history decides it will be great for time but none will remember you in less than a century they already dismembered you your family too living for two but never grew never knew what was possible before they applied the glue never knew what was possible before they applied the glue  {outro} x  "]}
