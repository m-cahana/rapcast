{"meek mill": ["  it definitely wasnt insulting. it was like me playing dion one-on-one in basketball. id tell you dion im going to slam on you. im going to cross you over im going to give you 30 points today. kendrick lamar i dont think he was trying to insult any of us you know. we all know each other personally.  its like a sport. i look at it like thats motivation as far as like he said your name that means youre dong something. if he didnt say your name\u2026 youve got to look at it like me going against kobe. im trying to kill him.  there were a lot of names that werent mentioned. i like those type of games. i definitely dont think it was an insult. it was a competition thing. a competitive type thing. i live for competition. everyone who knows me knows i dont want to lose in a game of nothing. i dont want to lose in a game of tic-tac-toe. im not going to make a diss record for kendrick lamar. but if he wants to get competitive were going to have some fun.
