{"logic": ["", "  this one wow this one meant a lot to me. first and foremost because the original growing pains i & ii were on mixtapes and before this album i did the mixtape welcome to forever and there was no growing pains from any part of the series on that. so i think a lot of people thought that its over and that there wasnt going to be another one and i wanted to give them that feeling of wow growing pains iii and all these people who heard these things on the mixtape like man hes still there. hes still logic like wow. im a fan i know what its like and you kind of dread like ohh whats that album gonna sound like for me i wanted to give them this  it opens up with a skit and i love wu-tang clan so i always loved their skits so its basically about the first time i ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy. and then it opens up:  outside i can hear em bussin bussin and the police they rushin go to my head like concussion  and im about fifteen years old at that time and the gunshots i still hear them every now and then throughout my life and im wondering i always used to wonder what caused that shootout why did i hear his what was it so i kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was in fact a true event. so that goes in when you first hear me rapping im laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind from the eviction notice on my door to being on food stamps and welfare not knowing whats going to happen tomorrow; just all the wonders. and then the beat changes up and i actually fall asleep. so this is my inner-most subconscious thoughts that i didnt even realize at the time at fifteen years old but now at twenty-four and looking back reminiscing i know that those are the things that are on my mind because growing up in that situation no matter what the only time i was special the only time i was anybody was when i was asleep. when i was asleep i was a famous basketball player baseball player i was a rapper/artist i was a singer i was an actor i was dancer i was an astronaut but when i woke up i was just a boy from a broken home. that was very hard to swallow  even touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family you know growing up on the cosbys  and family matters that was the closest thing i had to a real family. once the television program turned off or our electricity turned off  i snapped back to reality. i didnt end it on a bright note because theres people out there that feel that same way so i wanted them to know that im with them. im there. i was there i understand  "]}
