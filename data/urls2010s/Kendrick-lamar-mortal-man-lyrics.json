{"kendrick lamar & 2pac": ["", "   i remember you was conflicted misusing your influence sometimes i did the same abusing my power full of resentment resentment that turned into a deep depression found myself screaming in the hotel room i didnt wanna self destruct the evils of lucy was all around me so i went running for answers until i came home but that didnt stop survivors guilt going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned or maybe how a-1 my foundation was but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word was respect just because you wore a different gang color than mines doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another nigga shit and thats all i wrote i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like its something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa- about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground what you mean by that what the ground represent  the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil right thats how i see it my word is bond i see\u2014and the ground is the symbol for the poor people right the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat and they gonna be so appetizing you know what im saying wealthy appetizing the poor gonna be so poor and hungry right you know what im saying its gonna be like you know what im saying its gonna be... there might there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu- they might eat the rich you know what im saying  aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities  i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody managing me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for for us  and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity  by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true right you know what im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so its no problem you know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know im finna go straight through  would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall  shit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been uh threatened with resistance its been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what im saying its in my veins to fight back  aight well how long will you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wanna lay it all down  in this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you dont wanna fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers  thats crazy because me being one of your offsprings of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today  i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot its gonna be like uh bloodshed for real i dont think america know that i think american think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing its gonna be murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this motherfucker you know what im saying its gonna happen  thats crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lot a people dont understand how important it is you know sometimes i can like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of energy ima push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimes  because its spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn  i wanted to read one last thing to you its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it says: the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts hes trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city the result wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same whats your perspective on that pac pac pac  "], "kendrick lamar": ["  ", " the ghost of mandela hope my flows
