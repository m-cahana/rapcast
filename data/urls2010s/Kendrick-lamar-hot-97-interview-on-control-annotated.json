{"kendrick lamar": ["  on the response to the line im the king of new york:  it made me go back here and feel like i probably gotta dumb down my lyrics nowadays for people to take it way out of context the way they did\u2026 the main heads that really understood the context of the line was the actual kings of new york the cats that i sat down with this past week. theyre not understanding that its not about the culture its not about what side we on its about being great as biggie as pac the two cats that i referenced\u2026 i feel like im a student. im a student of the work that they did. when i put down 20 years in the game i can eventually plant my foot and have that same type of legacy\u2026 i never take the history behind what pac laid or what big laid.  on kendricks king of rap snoop dogg:  to keep it 100 with you snoop will always be number one and im from the west coast and he gave me that. but out of respect for my big homie i understand it. he laid down. i only got one album out homie. one album out. i got years to be doing this. at the end of the day snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where theyre at. but i cant stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.  on east/west rivalry in 2013:  i feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. no thats old school homie. we black men out here trying to uplift the culture. my first sold out show was in new york\u2026i respect the legends in the game. i respect people that done it before me people that lost their lives over this. because of what they laid down im gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it. thats the point of the whole verse what i was trying to convey through that verse. all the ignorance behind it you can kill that noise. itll never be like that again two coast rivalry. not on my behalf.
