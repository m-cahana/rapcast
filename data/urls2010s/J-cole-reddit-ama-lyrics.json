first answer favorite song is too hard to decide. but i will say runaway is definitely in the running. the verses production process is an easier question to answer for me. i just let it flow. normally i start out by finding drum sounds and patterns that make me move. for instance runaway started by flipping a real dirty drum loop then adding a harder kick on top. once i get drums that move me and excite me i look to add music samples or something im playing that make the marriage complete born sinner plays with a lot of double time tempos. shit like power trip that moves your head as if its fast paced. but in reality its technically a slow beat. the breakdown on land of the snakes another example. or rich niggas thanks for the question 7. what internet sites do you frequent non-music related  cole - can i be honest without getting killed off by reddit community. i go to digg a lot. i know reddit ethered digg a while ago because of the amazing community experience of reddit. but i still rock with them dont taze me bro 8. why wasnt the beat that was used in the first born sinner ustream used on the album  cole -

there is a lot of meaning on the album. so most meaningful is hard. but i really love the title track born sinner. because even though theres lots of pitfalls temptations dangers and tribulations on the album it ends in a hopeful place with im a born sinner but ill die better than that listen to those verses for more clarity. plus i touch on the things that are really important to me. relationship got her life in my grip family she hate the way she raised me but she loved what she raised friends if i died today my nigga was it business was it personal thank you 12. kid cudi self-produced the whole album indicud like you did on born sinner. what is you personal opinion on indicud  cole -

nas- undying love eminem- stan just mind blowing concepts tons more of course from more than just those rappers 22. why did you try and compete with kanye on the 18th wouldnt it make more sense to have your album release on a day with less competition  cole - just followed my instincts. i was confident in the album i had. didnt know what he had but didnt care. wanted to start the conversation. ive had a #1 album before. its cool. but i wouldnt have been able to live with myself wondering what if i would have moved my date 23. hi j. cole. i have a few questions for you but first off i would like to say thank you for taking time out of your day to do an ama here on hiphopheads. ive been a big fan of yours ever since my friend at school introduced me to some of your songs last year. i really wanted to come to your atlanta show a couple of days ago and support you and buy some merchandise but i found out that there was an age limit and i am only 15 what are your favorite things to do outside of rapping what job would you like to have if you didnt rap what has been the hardest part of your rapping career so far do you think of yourself as famous now that you have had two successful albums are you going to be releasing any winter merchandise for born sinner i would really like to have a hoody with the album art on it and wear it all around my campus thanks again for doing this ama i am looking foward to future album and mixtape releases  cole - if i didnt rap i have no clue what i would want to do. would take a lot of self re-evaluating to figure that out. too much passion for music to think of something else right now hardest part of my rap career so far was finding the balance. how to become a mainstream artist without losing myself. took a lot of experimenting trying things sometimes failing. but i found it born sinner crown hoodies on the way 24. what did yourself and drake do with all those copies of the album you bought what was your first feeling when the album leaked so far in advance  cole - i dont even know what happened to those copies. hopefully they gave them out to the people my first feeling when the album leaked 12 days in advance. was oh fuck 25. thank you for doing this ama j. cole to see my favorite rapper come to my favorite online community is really something special 3 days before sideline story dropped i was at your concert in tampa and you shouted me out at the end while doing farewell i was the white kid wearing a dreamville shirt heres a picture of me from that night http://imgur.com/dtnjlz1 when you have your next concert in tampa or the closest other venue i plan on wearing a shirt that says produce with j. cole or die trying i would really just like to get some advice on producing its become something i love to do and you are amazing at it anyways my question for you is how does it feel to have your idol nas rap over your own song saying that he is proud of you thank you once again ive been a fan since the warm up and your music has gotten me through some very hard times. sorry for fan girling but ive seen in interviews how youve talked about how much you liked nas as a kid where it felt like you knew him and thats exactly how i feel about you. keep making amazing music and thank you for helping bring back the real  cole -

newsroom is my favorite show. house of cards too. breaking bad is incredible i only saw the first 2 episodes and planned on watching every episode of every season to catch up. but never had time. so no i dont watch it but wish i could 27. hey cole. born sinner is easily the best album that came out on june 18th and your production and rapping was on point. i got two questions for you 1 why did you decide to not have any guest features spit a verse on born sinner 2 when can we expect your collab album with kendrick thanks for doing this ama cole  cole - thank you by the time i was wrapping up the album i started doing interviews and getting questions about features. i didnt have any rap features and i felt pressure to add some but quickly realized that i had already said what i wanted to say on this album. the mentality was who says you have to have other people rapping on your album  2 dont want to put a date on it 28. if you could would you have done born sinner differently  cole - nope   "]}
