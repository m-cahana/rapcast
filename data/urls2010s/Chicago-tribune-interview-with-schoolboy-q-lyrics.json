{"schoolboy q": ["  q: when they told you your album went to no. 1 were you surprised or did you think well obviously  a: i wasnt surprised. i expected it to do even better than it did. youve got to believe in yourself more than anything but no i expected it. it could have done better  q: you seem like youre hard on yourself  a: i am. its part of being a genius you know what i mean you take your time with everything and you evaluate everything. i havet rapped since i recorded my last song. i havent rapped in months. it takes time to put your life in your music. i got to gather my my thoughts back up and get back into that drive again. even my songs that party still got my real life in it  q: you put a lot of your real life in your songs which must be painful sometimes to make them and to perform them every night  a: its not hard. im not that person anymore. everything you hear on my records is not me at all anymore. im the complete opposite  q: how long did the album take you to make  a: two years to make it but it was worth it. im getting hella good reviews from it. even the bad reviews are calling it a good album. nobodys calling it wack and thats a success but mainly everybody praised it and called it an amazing piece of work  q: i never saw a bad review of it  a: youre not me so youre not searching. im searching everywhere from the small dude on youtube to the person on twitter that has 35 followers. i want everyones opinion. i like when people dislike my music. it lets me know how big i am as an artist. it lets me know my music is traveling. ... it makes me feel good to hear someone say i like kendrick more than q. it lets me know how far we came and how big we are as a company  q: as youre making your album kendricks album comes out and does well. what does that do to you it puts the pressure on right  a: some people call it pressure but it wasnt no real pressure. i know what i was gonna do. i was gonna sell regardless of kendrick. we have different fans. some people think im riding kendricks wave but in order to ride kendricks wave id have to have him on three songs on my album using the same producers doing the same kind of thing but were two completely completely different artists. i did it my way. people could say kendrick helped me. yes he did help me in the sense of putting me into the light but he didnt help me become a star. i did that myself. ... im more outspoken hes more observant. i say things when i shouldnt say them he says the right things. were two different people  q: youve talked about feeling more comfortable on this album. what changed  a: just me as a person. im just more comfortable being me. im not scared to be me. i love the honesty in my music. i dont think any rapper to this day puts as much honesty in their music as i do. i feel like everybody talks about stuff people already know. they talk about the government about how people are homeless outside the white house but we all know these things. what about your life i like to talk about my life my story the stuff i see.  q: a lot of the reviews point out that you talk about your life in an unvarnished way and they cant understand why theres no apology no moral to it. that sort of rap has fallen out of favor  a: you cant get an ivy league student to review hardcore hip-hop. they dont know anything about that. they cant understand the lingo. i just got into rock but i have no place reviewing rock music. ... thats not my life and thats not where i come from and i cant fully understand it. i just like what i like about it  q: but im sure a lot of your audience is middle-class white guys  a: they can relate to some of it not all of it. ... ive been to plenty of shows where i didnt fully understand the artists but i like what i like. the same thing happens every night with me  q do you look at it as something thats part of your job to make them understand  a i can care less. ... it is what it is. you either get it or you dont. as long as you like it thats whats up  "]}
