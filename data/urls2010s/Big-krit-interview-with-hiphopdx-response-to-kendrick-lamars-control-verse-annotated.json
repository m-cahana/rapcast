{"big k.r.i.t.": [" people kind of look at as being the future and my name just randomly popped up. so what i got an opportunity to see a little bit last night and this morning was just people that probably never tweeted me before whether it be negative or positive. for me it was like thank you for the promotion.  it let people know that yeah im from the south and yeah im country but you aint going to take me lightly. aint none of these rappers going to take me lightly on a record. and ", "", "  rap hip hop has always been mad competitive. its exciting because it was probably crazier for his fans for him to mention my name among rappers that people would consider top tier  know that. so thats why my name ended up on that list. if you think about 1 train or any record ima give my all. people know that im a lyricist and i can compete with some of the best and it is what is. i appreciate the shout out because thats really what it is. its a competitive sport; its a gladiator sport. dont nobody want to get murdered on a record. that just it is what is. so i dont know brother. i was like hell yeah. it is what it is. thank you for the shout out and shout out to all the fans that he may have that didnt know about my music and now they gon go back and listen to records and check out 1 train and want to know why he felt the need to mention my name. and im 100% sure he probably gets tired of going to barbershops and hearing my name mentioned where he is and vice-versa. its all good man. its all within the sport.
