{"xxxtentacion": ["", "   i see black skies and white lies id rather be dead filling my head with different enemies thoughts consuming me fueling my insecurities as the ground right under me crumbles as if it wasnt there its too much my hearts crushed im not alive i wont allow myself happiness cause its all lies ive seen the pain ive run away so many times death and i are companions its here at all times i wont love wont trust i wont die i cant feel but managed to steal your heart love was dirt poor now fuck whores and want love it seems that anything offered could be enough but its time body falls so i dont know who to call at all alone and my heart got tat of it broke im so fucking numb my life has succumb to hatred and death alone in the snow  "]}
