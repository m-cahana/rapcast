{"logic": ["", "  this is... one of my favorites on the album. its produced by rob knox and myself and um its such a blast with him creating the song. you know the classic break and just kind of doing my rendition of that break and putting that together and then rob just playing the keys and it rose over... its just such an incredible vibe. its basically a tale of um my time around the world - touring. starting out in college park maryland with all the homies back in the basement hitting the road in a minivan for the first time you know what im saying the first time ever in the freezing cold going to chicago and selling out my first show there... and different things like that until eventually going to europe and riding the train and  ended up in belgium and amsterdam and switzerland and this and that and all these really beautiful places. i just wanted to talk about it. talk about my fear of flying which im getting over all these just i wanted the people to hear the humility and the honesty and just like you know...  its weird even now recording this for spotify and the listeners now like i-i love spotify this is where i find all my samples and to think that theres somebody out there listening to me talk to them and they want to know about my album; its very surreal. thats what i believe encompasses  the song at least thats what... yeah its just about my travels; from a to b here to there and everywhere in between. it was originally going to be called planes trains and automobiles but i went with metropolis the neo-city of-of the world if you will its definitely filled with my cinematic inspiration - and you can hear it so yeah yeah enjoy it  "]}
