{"childish gambino": ["   @dc26  1. which track had the most interesting story or process 2. what do you think about when every things done and youre alone with nothing but your thoughts 3. which track is your favorite  @childishgambino  i guess oldest computer mackelmore was supposed to be on it but it became a little too house-y. then ms.banks came and made it a different song. it was cool to see  i never feel like everythings done honestly  urn @chitownguevara  what are you doing right now ;  @childishgambino  im hanging with notero nicole and eating sushi @mynamescody  are there more doors opened or closed in the entire world at this moment  @childishgambino  the problem is we see doors @brockemsockemz  1. what was your inspiration for flight of the navigator 2. favorite collab with chance the rapper  @childishgambino  i just felt really strange about death after seeing someone leave. i felt like it was a really cruel joke @skyart  1 what are you saying @2:23 on zealots\u2026 2 what is the meaning for some of the titles like sweatpants  @childishgambino  im saying wanna walk too  rich people wear whatever they want @clouds  during what season did you record this album  spring summer fall winter  did it have an effect on your songwriting/state of mind/et cetera  thnx  @childishgambino  i started christmas day of last year. we were recording on this mountain above weather so we werent cold unless we came down. i made it with winter in mind @streetlights  - will you be my friend and can we eat osso buco together - can you break down some of the beats on because the internet - how much influence do you get from kanye west  @childishgambino  i am def your friend if youre good with yourself and like to talk about stuff. notero loves my osso bucco @aknc17  sorry to get personal right away but people always ask basic ass questions in q and as so here it goes  i know you were raised jehovahs witness but do you still follow any type of religion  @childishgambino  i dont really believe in religion for myself. ive become spiritual more at peace with things. but i dont believe in god. not like that @goochcrucible  what website do you visit the most  @childishgambino  rap genius @thedarkknight  what was the meaning behind the title of clapping for the wrong reasons  @childishgambino  its a semi famous quote @robertf  donald can you explain the greatness of sades debut album diamond life. i would appreciate a very detailed explanation of why sade is so great and what she means to you as an artist. if you refuse to answer this question i will take it to mean you do not enjoy the musical styling of sade\u2026.and as such you will draw my full ire -22 y.o male who has just gotten heavily into sades music  @childishgambino  i was literally listening to sade yesterday. shes a world artist. and her music is just in tune with whatever vibration we all run on. i cant answer a lot of your questions about her all i can say is shes a special artist/being @maxgertler  what does the ending of the last song symbolize like that life can end at any second randomly  @childishgambino  you should read the because the internet script when its released @crookedmoderator  if you could trade hairlines with another person who would it be  @childishgambino  they tell me i should fix my hairline cause i got money now  i aint gon sit around and front like i aint thought about it  a perfect hairline is more appealing but its funny how  my shit is fucked uppppppp but look how far i done got without it  i keep my half of an octagon hairline fucked up just to show the kids its real @kid_kamikazee  what did your followers realize at the end of the biggest troll  @childishgambino  they realize they dont need a leader @fran-soul  dude you are awesome love your music and my question is do you ever see your self touring africa coz thats the only way i will ever see you unless you buy me a plane ticket to see you live in the us  pliz respond  @childishgambino  i really wanna see africa. we were planning on south africa soon @wiggitywackwes  1. there were huge jumps style-wise and sonically from camp to royalty to because the internet do you see yourself developing a signature sound or do you plan on keeping things experimental and constantly trying new sounds  2. your music has helped me through a lot and continues to so i just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for what you do. thank you  @childishgambino  thanks  i always wanna experiment. in everything. ill always try to push myself. i just never wanna be bored @raybeach  do you make things that have or message or do you just let people interpret it kind of like 3005  @childishgambino  i make things with messages for me in them. i hope they translate. sometimes they dont and thats fine but i usually just try to touch on something thats intangible for me @basedgator  question part: what inspires you when it comes to production i hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album which make sense since your from the south but you didnt really do that on camp. then you got something like zealots of stockholm where it gets death grip-ish. is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things  since your probably not going to see/respond to this let me stan a little bit haha  stan part: you are my role model i can identify with your life and lyrics so well its crazy. i really hope in 10 years i can be as successful and well respected as you. i already liked your comedy and acting but ever since i found out you rapped and i heard that e.e. cummings line in freaks and geeks i was hooked. anyway the new album is dope as heck great work as always sir and i cant wait to see what you do in the future      @childishgambino  ha. thanks  i try not to think to hard about whats trap drums whats influenced by whos hot now and all that. i try to just find what feels honest. cause i dont know if id wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone but was no fun to make. this album tho it came from a messy place was by far the most fun to make @savvyrja  it sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot care to elaborate  @childishgambino  to be honest i dont know much about him. i was always a beach boys dude over beatles. i learned a little about him through jhene @savvyrja  who is your favorite artist outside of hip-hop  perosnally gorillaz or red hot chilli peppers  @childishgambino  anything by sam cooke @griffinmahon  do you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to full-length movies does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap  @childishgambino  short films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we dont have a lot of time to spend. a short film for me leaves more to the audience and doesnt take so much time. and if its free then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion @flowmatic  whats your perspective on camp looking back at it now   @childishgambino  i love camp. it theres little things id change cause i know how music better but yeah. i does what its supposed to do @flytendencies  how do you sing so beautifully  @childishgambino  thats what you call it @a1_day  did my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and yeezuss sound play a role in because the internet how big of a influence is kanye to you  @childishgambino  i guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better but honestly his whole steez isnt for me. i cant do that. he just inspires me to be limitless @stefanponce  can you break down the song to boy band   @childishgambino   @myh  how can mirrors be real if our eyes arent real  @childishgambino  mirrors arent real @metron  whats the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life did you explain the abrupt ending on life: the biggest troll  i forgot to @ before cuz i was excited  @childishgambino  i dont feel like ive missed any opportunity honestly @grizzycreekwater  3 questions :  1 favourite cartoon  what is your choice   2 would you ever do more stand-up shows or skits for youtube   3 favourite album in 2013  from any genre   @childishgambino  i really like china il. american dad has the best jokes. adventure time. regular show. amazing world of gumball @brockemsockemz  if you were an animal what would you be  @childishgambino  koala @savvyrja  who is your favorite philosopher  @childishgambino  patrice oneal and louis ck @darwin_shameran  you have andrew auernheimer in your song weev andrew is openly known as a racist and anti-semite how come you decided to include him  @childishgambino  video @eon2323  hey donald big fan here actually #1 gambino scholar here but nbd. i have a couple of questions  1 do you have a whole bunch of those white shirts or is

were on set @akonomiles  my question to you childish is what advice do you have for all the creatives out there that work so much on polishing their craft. that surround themselves with all types of shit music art etc and try as much to absorb to than emit that knowledge into their work. what advice do you have childish cause sometimes i be feeling like im going nowhere. especially seeing others who do what i do get further than me when their ideas are really nothing but regurgetated shit weve all seen. i just feel like im going crazy sometimes yo. haha. thanks \u2014 akono  @childishgambino  yeah. i think you have just look at what y o u really want. it can be frustrating. but u also have to know how people work and what people want from you  you should read mastery by robert greene
