{"": ["", "   teriyaki joe: neo-harlem detective  chapter 4: pie  slurp..slurp...slurp...sluuuuurp...slurpslurpslurpslurp...hmmmph...aaah...*gulp* :  happy valentines day baby she says with a wink. i fell for the mohawk. she fell for the 10000 units. the business of love in the streets  had to relieve some tension before i made my first move. decisions made while being tense always come back to bite you in the ass. clarity  everybody just for 1 person. seems a bit extreme. even for a parker. youd think all that taichi would make them a little more peaceful  a little more humane. hell even a little more robotic would be nice at least they have a valid point. this whole thing has funk on it  i know 11 was serious though. deadly serious. serious as the 100 million units he winked at me when i refused to take the job  serious when he said in 5 days hed update every food pill in neo-harlem so instead of the shakes you got the deads right after dinner. ;  get rich and save neo-harlem. i like that.  getting lost in the voodoo and probably end up destroying neo-harlem anyway. i dont like that  things tend to get real possible when you got a gun to your head or money in your hands. i got both. mix fear with reward. im impressed  lost dogs are easy. easy as pie. find some shabby two-unit witch doctor have him call some flea bag back from the voodoo exorcise & upload  getting a human soul back from the afterlife is lets say a little more complicated than that. not pie at all. devils pie is what it is  shit  ---end of chapter 4---  "]}
