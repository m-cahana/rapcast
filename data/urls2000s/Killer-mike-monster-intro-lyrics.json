{"killer mike": ["", "   peace will never tame the hatred in me im too restricted separated from your society im a new breed of species a curse to lips that speaks my name im different twisted my mind is not the same for those who deny the truth but seek to try and find it you my friend are blind to the truth for you are simple minded my ways are called abnormal they treat me as if forsaken but all shall fear the wrath just like when my heart was taken and if these words fail to reach the ears of the limited few you wont know but when i strike youll wish that you would have knew this beast is on the loose if you treasure life then destroy it word is too realistic for you to simply ignore it  ive given a fair warning and ive been well because im cutting loose a new terror walks the earth and now its all up to you if all hope should fair then you should sit and ponder your fate has been decided by one dangerous monster  "]}
