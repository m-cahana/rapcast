{"canibus": ["  the c of tranquility canibus spit for infinity i revolve with the earth lyrically uh echoes  yea yall wassup the ripper right here can-i-bus yo yo  i rest alone in a cold cabin composed of stone from old agate a sarcophagus filled with gold tablets the archaeological dig-site excavated the bone matter of this unknown rapper the blood of the gorgon was used as a cure for the poison the poison that destroyed his organs his dna was shaped like a series of sideways 8s space time is converted to time space the soundwave signals looks like ocean tides when they ripple he spit to precision instrumentals sidewinder rhymes hit you split you the target area surface was no wider than a nickel control room simple.. his chair was chiseled from quartz crystal it gets so hot his skin sizzle he piloted the missile from a digital menu inside remote headgear he would put on to look into by mastery of the mental he was able to see what the past and future civilizations had been through acoustic imagery transmitted through the music n energy when im spittin no distance can limit me the gallery of my art was refabricated and placed in a ark but grave robbers rip the pages apart they got caught whoever told me the secret is now dead i cannot tell you or i will end up like them the meaning of these rhymes are dead to the modern day mind even if you hear this a thousand times because if this many have died ya inner light will not shine if ya pineal gland is calcified the silver cord is a metaphor for the will of the lord i was called to climb aboard and explore thats when i saw the tree of life in the yard the apples on the floor were gored to the core the coil spirals remind you but be mindful external experience reflects whats inside you inside us all behind the wall inside ya skull but exposed in a song ahhhhhh i was struck in an electrical storm the flesh on my left arm is scarred the mics gone  "]}
