came to rule this stage with that budden swag\u2026 thats a visual punchline im bout to get in my fucking bag damn you make light skin niggas look bad but that aint even why im mad i had this booked with ondemand and it was crazy litigations he said he want his peoples to do it even though talk is cheap i said pay me in a statement i was feeling weird cause they millionaires but they was lazy with the payments cut my cash in half and now im in a shady situation i mean maybe im just bugging joe signed with shady shady picked the judges plus they wont pay me what i wanted these labels think they something we live and breathe the shit ceos they just get stats and read the shit like hundreds of millions of views off of battles we need this shit well take 85% fuck an equal split well have sway come and host hell read the script what about the battlers in the house mehh throw em a couple gs thats it\u2026 wow geez thats it jimmy iovine die please and rosenberg eat a dick you fat piece of shit trying to book his own league for chips but barely even seen a clip when they first asked paul about battles he said no luck now you dont want to see us fail sho nuff i know it all its about slaughterhouse the cd sales done slowed up lets be real besides em drake and hov the rest of these rappers is barely breaking gold whoa\u2026 so big bozo it well homie gon clown this nigga destroy every person place and thing i will noun this nigga i know yall like hollow all over this stage he wilding nigga im just giving yall a preview im bout to rap circles around this nigga he cant escape he a ho to me he too/two bitch floetry he get close to me\u2026 nah put up that jagged edge i got 112 i want joe to see jodeci since total slaughter shitted on the champ ima act a fool quick itll be ill when them two 4s in the center of the bull shit i know thats an old reference and some of yall might not have known what i said that aint something you caught right well cool it was for em to go over ya head im shooting like craig hodges that arm strong i aint missing nothing and you dennis rodman cause you nice around that mic/mike but sometimes you a bitch in public when that occurs kurr long nose ill pippen something since joe dirt old shirt ima have yall missing buttons/buddens now i know you probably thought that was a punchline about how a shirt is missing buttons but it was about the movie joe dirt he used to wear an old shirt that was missing buttons i went psycho melee round the time we thought\u2026", " you came to this battle shit but you aint in me league with this cause the way you spitting it sounds like youre reading it damn you make light skin niggas look bad but that aint even why im mad you thinking you gon win this battle is why im mad tho oh you dont think you gon get beat bet a band yo banjo you talking bout all this practice and you aint got no dough joe dojo well that aint enough to buy swag you gon need some mo joe mojo ya last hit was 2003 you unsuccessful brother jojo i mean you had a little run but its been a long stretch since we heard a track we can feel with ya flow joe i mean in his prime he struggled to go gold but yall claiming this cats platinum if thats factual youll have sold out arenas not here at smack rapping you giving out ya mixtape for free like you backpacking i mean you cant make a hit so you battle thats random i finally can say this lay off the pills you crack addict popping that e got you feeling like oj you wanna take a stab at it well thats backwards cause his names joe e-o-j thats backwards my bar went over his head thats madness you did have smash hits like pump it up and\u2026 pump it up um\u2026. pump it up the rem- okay so eminem helped his career with slaughterhouse to see it grow go figure his pockets aint get no bigger by you being a ho nigga on a tv show i mean if he really was a platinum artist eminem be like dont battle were about to let your cd go youre an important artist and this is too much of a risk for a ceo but since he didnt this ems way of saying joe youre free to go i mean they already had the meeting once hollow beat him theres no way to get around it now shadys turn to italians that live in an island theyre like fugget about em his stats dont match up it dont fit the column now im like nas cause i put the end to the nigga album yall dont remember nas had the n on his nigga album my bars go over his head yall niggas wilding who wanna try all you can get killed when i let something fly all you\u2026 killed\u2026 aint no punchline that fucking time its hard being a battle rapper we always gotta fucking rhyme rehearse and research and barely get a fucking dime i mean besides the fact total slaughter aint paying us the figures is meaningless if you aint getting it genius let me breakdown the difference between us you do whatever em say hollow; he do whatever him say i mean you go to a studio go in punch in ya bars i go to a battle and go in once im punching my bars you was on sports center recording on first take this sports centered around us recording on first take so in my heart i got hella hate nigga the day you die we gon celebrate ill have him down from one 40 140 he a featherweight i know that last studio scheme was hella great but i mixed a few styles and mastered this lets get the record straight should i talk about raekwon or saigon i mean all them beefs i just dont understand it play it like the games green lantern but im smoother than holding the standard i could give a con consequence to p prodigy hell toe him and tag him but i dont wanna put a price on his head so ill just hold him for ransom my nigga\u2026 you got punched in ya eye it wasnt aight he did a blog like see what had happened was\u2026 yo yo go get me some more ice he held that bitch on for so long his eyeball got frost bite and when he finally took it off that bitch look like a fog light but i keep it queens like a tragedy/khadafi story pop bout them gory blocks or that old block that n.o.r.e. shot in front of stock one with that 40 glock or i keep it h town have my niggas from eastside have him hogtied my brothers from parkside leave his mouth wide stand over his body and do the southside or may i reiterate you know how these labels go take a artist rape him slow with that fellacio his tape went gold but he gotta do 80 shows to make some dough you try to do that to battle rap and im saying no to this shady show and thats the staff eminem\u2026 you still my favorite bro but this aint smart move for your boss who employed you for not shutting this down yall should fire marshall  ", " bars off the top they know its all rage smoke you like that bogie ima smoke you on stage you still rapping old school ol skool like this cause you a old nigga talking all about ya benjamins with ya valore suit with the gold zipper third round these bars gon stay with him dead beat dad i aint got time to play with him k hit em take a part of him for you new fans yeah.. its back to them gun bars again at first i held that dessie i wasnt ready nigga i had to hold it with 2 hands its a heavy hitter that bitch kick when it shoot like reggie miller i mean i thought surf would show you the way i could tell thats why he sitting there from what you show and display as a writer were knowing you great but you mustve came up with those home alone cause ya setups is all over the place i come to jersey city or any jersey city just to shoot at ya cause when you put us cats in heat together well spray up the house that aint new to neuter them yall booing and these mics is fucked up but i dont give a fuck so whats that sound shh thats my punchline that went over ya head let em hover round and these bars are like clubs that dont want niggas to come around cuz these bars are only wearing button budden down but i know what yall here for lets talk about the women in ya life i mean cuz i never seen a clique with day 1 niggas on side of you you know its sad when ya r&b singer emannys the only nigga thatll ride for you so lets talk about the women in ya life they been shitting on you since 03 tho gloria velez said you oh so gay i said if hed ever come out the closet she said joe no sayyo no se i kinda figured that with tahiry the way he be treating her spreading her business on social media even beating her beating her my nigga "]}
