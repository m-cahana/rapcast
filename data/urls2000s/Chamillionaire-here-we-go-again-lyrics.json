frank thomas the baseball player you know the the one that played for the white sox uncle ro and hurt m badd is how i hooked up with him thought he could put us in the right spots let me connect the dots... on the chi block had two cartier rings that was iced out a secretary named lorraine that was quite hot told me to meet him at the studio 5 oclock tryna get to the studio picked up in a limo i recorded a demo and you know my mo h-town slow it way down here i picked up the tempo thought it was a benzo but he wasnt in a benzo i hopped out the car and frank saw me in a parking lot in his ferrari he opened the door and the leather was looking godly real talk couldve cost a mill he was back from new york he had shopped a deal he met with them talked about my appeal all the labels were talking but not for real well i think youre wise and at least ya tried at least we know that theyll see you rise at least youre floating on decent tires im headed home but dont be surprised thats where i be if they want me they prolly dont but just call me gave me a couple of stacks because he knew i was headed right back to the hood i think it scarred me then i got on the plane headed back to houston like its part of the game gave the money to my mother and she couldnt complain then i headed to the swishahouse and started a flame everything started moving up after high school we was cool enough im like this aint got nothin to do with luck i watched slim and braceface candy blue a truck the 312 what i got to dial i called hurt m badd like we got a lot to smile.. ..about hurt we can make a profit now i need beats because were about to put an album out that conversation wasnt friendly thought he had some beats that he could lend me but he told me that they have a price tag and a beat from him would cost 10 gs thats when my heart turned empty i wasnt trying to get them free but didnt think that you would rob me i recorded all them songs for you and never asked you for a dollar now you tryna charge me *click* on the window pane we can all see the rain somebody gotta let me know what part of the game is this wait now i got a call from lorraine hello whats up shes no longer working with frank at all and told me the reason she made the call is to tell what really happened with the major talk they liked you cham and they said youre raw they liked your music but hated all the rest of the artist he told them nah you wanna sign him gotta pay us all i knew that i wasnt ever signed to her i knew that i wasnt ever signed to frank and frank he already had a lot of bank im never letting anyone decide my fate who knew that i would do what i do who knew that michael watts would try to screw what he screw who knew that ron c was good at screwin it too and how can anybody act like they had a clue we wasnt sittin by a stewardess you wasnt riding on the tour bus and it was more than a few of us i couldnt tell you where the jeweler was but i could tell you where the sewer was labels were was suing us switch back to chicago where everybody duck 5-0 and pimps ride fly though they say in god we trust but keep a weapon in the bible he said what it look like joe he was
