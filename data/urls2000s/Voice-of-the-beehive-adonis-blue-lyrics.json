{"mike jones": ["  ill give myself a vision for a boy for this one girl he can be the colors of a paintbox set in a black and white world. hell be a bit of everything be the silver in the clouds be a whisper silent as a kiss or a scream thats just as loud. i know he can be found adonis blue adonis blue. sad like me but hes always smiling. you cant find me i cant find you youre tried and true. its only you adonis blue hell be the stroke of midnight or the mornings faithful rise. be the music buried in the garden of a church like the loveliest surprise. i heard there isnt anyone that the breed has long been gone i still not sure that im convinced gonna try to prove them wrong. gonna look and look hard and long wish upon a star pull the petals from a flower make a special wish when the clock strikes certain hours blow out the candles on the cake pitch the pennies in the fountain. god speed him to me. i promise ill be good ill be waiting by the window ill be sitting in the dark. hes just gotta be there cause ive looked so very hard adonis blue hes a boy come true a little bit of him a little of you. cherub face with those dug in heels. hes everything i mean. hes everything i feel. rag doll singing in the slippery city rain plugging in my circuits. dancing in my brain. adonis blue. hes a boy divine. gonna to try to find him. gonna make him mine. if i only knew adonis blue. ill give myself a vision  "]}
