{"50 cent": ["  every rapper who grew up in the nineties owes something to 2pac. people either try to emulate him in some way or they go in a different direction because they didnt like what he did. but whatever you think of him he definitely developed his own style: he didnt sound like anyone who came before him.  my favorite 2pac album is the don killuminati. it was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. it was like a doctor told him he was going to die and he was trying to get it all down on paper. thats something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept and stay in that negative space. everybody knows that theyre going to die. but after youre in a life-threatening situation you think about it a little more.  2pacs aggressive records are my favorite. hail mary is just perfect: picture paragraphs unloaded/wise words being quoted. most artists now just arent smart enough to write that or honest enough to write a line like i aint a killer but dont push me. these days rappers will just tell you ill kill you.  2pac was like a camera. its incredible how much he wrote \u2014 how much he documented. to me pac was more of a poet than a rapper. you can always tell when youre hearing 2pac verse. he wrote those lyrics without any music. notorious b.i.g. was more melody-driven \u2014 im sure he wrote his shit without a pen and over the music \u2014 but pac was just hashing out his life. the thing was he was doing that when the public eye was on him and everything he was hashing out just expanded and thats when things got out of control.  all of us on the east coast loved 2pac. the music was all that mattered. that east coast/west coast feud was just personal beef. now that hes not here hes bigger than ever. i can still listen to two or three 2pac cds straight. sometimes i put on 2pacs best songs followed by biggies best songs. then i get ready to go into my next project.  laurence fishburne told me once that he didnt like 2pac. he told me it was because 2pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. he said he didnt like the way 2pac behaved because he knew that 2pac knew better. i understood what he meant. but i still gave him a look like he was bugging.
