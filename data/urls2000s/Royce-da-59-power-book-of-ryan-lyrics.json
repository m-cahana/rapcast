was walking out on them left and right yknow he never left us he was always there for us yknow there were a lot of things that happened that i didnt understand maybe i might not have answered the question the same way when i was a teenager but i understand and appreciate him so much more now as a man yknow cause he taught me respect and discipline and consequences for your acts so yeah of course do you think his approach as a father really shaped the type of father that you are today or do you in some ways think it had negatives to it and if so what kind of negative traits do you try to avoid having as a father right now to me when you have your own youll understand  "], "royce da 5'9": [" you want what for christmas hell no whatchu mean this is all we got thats it  ", " its
