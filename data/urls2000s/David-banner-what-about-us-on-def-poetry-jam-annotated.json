{"david banner": ["  the levees broke in new orleans and man it was a shame that the camera crews and the national news merely whispered our names mississippi what about us. was it the value of the land or the worth of the man that made you look away when katrina hit like bam. celebrities weeping in louisiana streets while rubble and destruction still in mississippi what about us. once again victims of national neglect poor response choked our hope like a noose around our necks. the national leaders left us hanging like the day of the tall trees while the wind and rain pauses while the wind and rain erased our lives. but most of yall acted like you didnt see. how the hell do you expect us to be mentally free. what about us. wheres the healing the glass ceiling that our nation has erected our children not protected feeling dejected hanging their spirits in shame because they were born in a place thats synonymous with pain. though the weather changed more shit remains the same. we keep playing americas fucked up game. what about us. the constitution guarantees equal protection there must be a connection between what the government says and what the government does not do. the world watches tv and think that with through building and that with through repairing while the effects of katrina are still glaring...what the fuck about us. what about us and since nobody else will say it i will mississippi what about us.
