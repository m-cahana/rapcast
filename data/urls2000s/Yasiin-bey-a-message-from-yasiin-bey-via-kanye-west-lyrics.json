i had to let that out. peace to all fear none this is yasiin bey. at this present time i am currently in cape town south africa and im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason. theyre saying that they want to deport my family. uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that i was traveling with is fictitious which it is not. anyone can do the research about the world passport; its not a fictitious document. it is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all. in fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in south africa in ports johannesburg and cape town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. you can see the stamps; theyre there at the world service authority for anyone to investigate. to quote lil durk i am not a liar. ive made no false claims. i have not misrepresented myself. im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and i have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also um...its curious. i havent broken any law and im being treated like a criminal. i know im not unique in that regard and i am grateful that im here with my family. i havent been physically harmed or anything like that. however i have been detained. people in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily. theres no reason i have to spend any time in the cell. theres no reason i had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all. this is not an administration of justice and all i seek is to leave the state. im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that. people keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because im not- i just wanna go home and i dont live in america and i have the right to domicile wherever i please without fear or without interference  the state of south africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily. and thats fine; we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either. my family and i are prepared immediately to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state never to return to this state again. we dont have to be here. were not pining to be here and were complying in every possible way reasonably. just today state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family and they had no right to do so. i have legal representation here who they could easily contact. theyre contravening and breaking all types of international law and its untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. and i know its been a lot of chatter about whats going on you know people are running to the press because thats just\u2026you know a money making machine. so its another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera some tele-novella and i have no interest in it. furthermore related but not directly related to this: im retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today and also from hollywood effective immediately. i am releasing my final album this year. um\u2026and thats that  peace to all fear of none. thank everyone for their time. much success to you even if you wish me the opposite as nas said. and im on the side of the right so people could wish however they want but i aint nobodys\u2026i aint no threat or a hazard to nobody. i really try to mind my business. what people think about me is none of my business and im not here to change peoples opinions about me. you dont have to like me; you dont have to like everything that i say. the fact is is that i have hurt no one. i have injured no parties and all i require as is my lawful right is innocent passage to my domicile. that is all  in summary i will say this i will close with a simple prayer: to the one who has created the all you know me better than i know myself and i know myself better than people know me. so forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. ameen ameen allahumma ameen  and ill close for you ye with the with the verse that i kicked for you on december 31st when you was in atlantic city and you announced that you and kim were having nori. and and shout out to madlib and otis and\u2026and\u2026and michael and his entire family and to mama jackson and to the whole jackson clan in l.a. i wish you and your family the best your mother you know reach out to me egon you know yall know how to reach. shout out to corey smyth shout out to my brother talib kweli salaam to my brother kamaal fareed ali shaheed muhammad islam all of the zulu nation. the zulu nation real here; theres real zulus. my brother siyabonga the madlalas. all of the people here who have supported me: this is no reflection on you. i love the people of this country. i love this continent. i do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. they waste enough of my time and... im through with you felicia... were through. i dont want nothing from you. you can keep the records the sweatshirts everything; its no problem. but ill end with this verse that i wanna put on no more parties in la if you would kindly allow me my dear brother kanye. and shout out to k. lamar too; i see you my dude lonely america crazy america loud ass country ass cocaine america lethal america carcinogen asthma carbonated smoke throughout your blood plasma lights and camera action surveillance helicopters teleprompters flossy newscasters rich fool bastards war migrant workers cold murder traffic welcome to los... stop right there biggie got shot right here angeles hollywood hoes handguns  peace to all fear none. this is bey. love. one  "]}
