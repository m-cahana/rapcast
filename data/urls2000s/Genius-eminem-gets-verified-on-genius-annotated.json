{"eminem": ["  let the horns blow: eminem has annotated selections from his entire catalog for genius. below are a few highlights \u2014 to see all the annotations go to eminems profile page. eminem recalled his first studio session with dr. dre and the creation of my name is a song that was recorded in one take and launched him into superstardom: dre put on the labi siffre record and i was just like hi my name is that beat was talking to me. i was like yo this is it this is my shot. if i dont impress this guy im going back home and im fucked. i knew dre wasnt an easy person to please. i made sure that everything he had a beat for i had a rhyme ready to go or i came up with a rhyme on the spot  my name is was the first thing that came out of my mouth that first day i was at dres house. i dont know if we released what i did the first day or if i re-did it but it was basically the same. i didnt understand punching or believe in it. so i would just go from the top of the song all the way down. i was never flying in hooks. everything was live one take. if i got all the way to the fucking end and messed up the last word id be like run it back lets do it again. i remember dre was like yo are you fucking crazy lets just punch. i didnt like that concept because i wasnt used to it. when we were recording here in detroit in the beginning i was saving up my money to go in. we only had an hour you know im like one take down alright lets go to the next song. fuck it. thats what i was used to.marshall explained where the name slim shady came from in an annotation on the song just dont give a fuck: coming out with an alias was part of proofs whole idea. he said lets be in a group called d12 and there will be six of us and well each have an alias. well each be two different people. when i started rapping as shady as that character it was a way for me to vent all my frustrations and just blame it on him. if anybody got mad about it it was him that said it you know what im saying it was a way for me to be myself and say what i felt. i never wanted to go back to just rapping regular again.in another annotation on the same song eminem explained that he started writing songs like just dont give a fuck because people were saying that i sounded like az and nas. em broke down a few lyrics from lose yourself clarifying whose sweater the vomit was on in the first verse: the first verse is all about jimmy smith jr. its me talking about jimmy smith jr. \u2014 like im not saying my sweater im saying his. im trying to show you what his life is about.on the original demo version of lose yourself: this is going to sound stupid but i have no recollection of the demo version on shady xv. i dont know where i recorded it i dont even know when i recorded it. i did a lot of drugs so my memory is all over the place.find three more annotations from eminem on lose yourself here. on how the lyrics of didos thank you helped inspire stan: when i heard your picture on my wall i was like yo this could be about somebody who takes me too seriously. so i knew what i was going to write about before i wrote it. a lot of times when im writing songs i see visions for everything im writing. this was one of those.on the decision to make in da club the first single off 50 cents interscope debut: we couldnt decide on the first single from get rich. it was going to be either if i cant or in da club. we were torn so me 50 paul chris lighty and jimmy iovine decided to flip a coin.on jay zs renegade em explained his thought process when writing: when im writing im in the syllable game. im connecting 5-6-7-8 syllable phrases where every syllable rhymes. i get heavy into that. when i start rapping something and i think of more syllables that connect with it sometimes i want to just keep the scheme going forever  ive done it before in songs where the syllable scheme of the first verse ends up being the syllable scheme of the second verse and the third verse \u2014 all the way down. i do it because the lines start connecting and making sense. once i find something and lock in it comes out pretty quick.marshall also annotated a fan favorite sing for the moment explaining why he kept going despite the criticism he received early in his career: this is where i was dealing with critics who didnt understand why people were identifying with me. i realized i was becoming like the rappers that i looked up to as a kid. i identified with and loved ll cool j and the beastie boys. i felt like if everybody didnt understand their music it didnt matter \u2014 they were speaking to me. so thats what i was trying to make people realize on this track. i may not be shit to you but theres a kid in fucking nebraska or somewhere that im talking to. i dont care if youre listening because hes listening. thats who im directing my material at.on rap god marshall said the only thing he would do other than rhyme is play for the detroit lions: the hook was the first phrase i thought of when i heard the track. i thought okay this has something to it and might be catchy but \u2014 im a rap god why if im going to say that i need to validate that.  i dont want to say its the crutch exactly but the theme of the whole song is: this is the only thing i know how to do. i dont know how to do anything else aside from play a little bit of basketball. except if the lions called me. im down to be receiver or something or a running back. id be good for that.you can read two more annotations from eminem on rap god here.  eminem also annotated a vintage biggie/2pac freestyle from 1999 commenting on past and present mcs: theres people who rap to make songs just because they enjoy doing it and want to express themselves. and then there are people who rap competitively. i believe that anybody who competitively raps \u2014 like drake and kendrick and jay z \u2014 raps to be the best rapper. people diss each other but its more in the vein of how can i kill you with record sales or with a flow how can i be better than you at making records at punchlines metaphors wordplay syllables  but when you have two rappers like biggie and 2pac getting into it you get the hip hop community torn. no one wants to see something real happen. if for a second you entertain the idea of that being entertaining if something ever happened out of that no. thats not healthy.click here to view all
