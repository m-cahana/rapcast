{"dmx": ["  i come to you hungry and tired you give me food and let me sleep i come to you weak you give me strength and thats deep you call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures only asking that i keep the focus in between the chapters you give me the word and only ask that i interpret and give me the eyes that i may recognize the serpent you know i aint perfect but youd like me to try unlike the devil who just wants me to lie til i die lord why is it that i go through so much pain all i saw was black all i felt was rain i come to you because its you who knows you showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed you gave me the light and let me bask in your glory so it was only right that when you ask for this story i put it together to do our dogs some good our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood plenty of times you sent help my way but i hid and i remember once you held me close but i slid there was something that i just had to see that you wanted me to see so i can be what you wanted me to be and i think ive seen it cause i dont feel the same matter of fact i know ive seen it i can feel the change and its strange almost got me beating down your door but i have never known a love like this before its a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain and up under the ceiling i get away from the rain and the strain that i feel when im here is gone i know real so i wipe away the tears; its on and i almost lost faith when you took my man monty paso and jays brother dan and i fear that what im saying wont be heard until im gone but its all good cause i really didnt expect to live long so if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light give me pain til i die but please lord treat him right  "]}
