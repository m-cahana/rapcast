{"eminem": ["   dear afeni  sorry if it looks a little sloppy i couldve done a little better if i had the right pencils. instead i had to draw it in pen. plus i just kind of thought of the idea a little too late. but ive been drawing since i was 10 and i thought you might like it. anyways thank you for always being so kind to me. you are a true queen and i mean that in every sense of the word. i will never forget the opportunities you have given me. you will always be in my heart my thoughts and my prayers. as i have said before you have no idea how much your son and his music has inspired not only the hip hop world but speaking for myself has inspired my whole career. he was and still is the true definition of a soldier. when i was feeling at my worst; before fame before dre i knew i could put that 2pac tape in and suddenly things werent so bad. he gave me the courage to stand up and say f**k the world this is who i am and if you dont like it go f**k yourself thank you for giving us his spirit and yours god bless you  love  marshall  "]}
