{"young gunz": ["  balanced on the edge of a knife* in love with the night so ill ignore the cracks in the ice and ill raise my glass sing a toast to the end of all things baby cos daylight wont wait for me  oh what has become of me turn the lights out cos i dont want to see what ive become  im condemned to walk the night and i dont care no i dont care cos in the morning light the mirror lies cos im not there no im not there  now im become destroyer of worlds at the very least my own so ill sit on the tracks and ill wait and ill raise my glass sing a toast to the end of all things baby but im drinking alone  oh what has become of me turn the lights out cos i dont want to see what ive become  im condemned to walk the night and i dont care no i dont care cos in the morning light the mirror lies cos im not there no im not there  you you are the sun and if you are the sun you can keep me in the dark  what have i become horns where there were none before what have i become horns where there were none before so just leave me in the dark  what have i become horns where there were none before what have i become horns where there were none before  "]}
