common poodle im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil its me my honestys brutal but its honestly futile if i dont utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin to censor you like that one line i said on im back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak-47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im morphin into an immortal comin through the

words to use. let me know when it occurs to you while im rippin any one of these verses that versus you its curtains im inadvertently hurtin you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins to ungh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to and im a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but its still tongue-in-cheek fuck you im drunk \u2013 so satan take the fucking wheel ima sleep in the front seat bumpin heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head theres something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then but if i cant batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then dont mistake him for satan; its a fatal mistake if you think i
