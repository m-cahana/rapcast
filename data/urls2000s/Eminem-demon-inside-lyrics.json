{"eminem": ["  im possessed by evil demons that torture me while im sleeping i keep dreaming of death and im hearing people screaming the devils spirits trapped inside me and i want it out im on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house with both of my wrists slit im lifted up in the air and suspended in animation like someones holding me there i feel somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes tripping over odd bodies of dead lushes bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house melts my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters caught a piece of shrapnel in the adams apple two cups of holy water and im looking at em half full but as soon as i go to touch em they turn into red rum it got silent then all these voices said come follow me into the gates of hell i heard em yell welcome to the norman bates motel i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess and told me thats just for starters satanll be in to see me later to see if im interested in being partners  "]}
