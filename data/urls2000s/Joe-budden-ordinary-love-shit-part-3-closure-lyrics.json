{"joe budden": [" new joe budden one and two was for yall this ones for me check this talk to em  ", "", "   i finally found a passion i lacked before cant believe i didnt catch ya under the act before i mean i voiced my complaints that went ignored a few things you felt that you was too attractive for cause eerything out your mouth said that you aint wanna hurt love the lifestyle we lived but you aint wanna work so id sit you down and say its getting outta hand while you shoot down eery idea busy worried about a brand when ya baby dad said all that shit that was trife how you was married requesting dick pics from lyfe though it all seemed shady maybe i was crazy i ignored my gut feelin nah not my baby accusing me but pretending yourself i couldnt catch it too busy defending myself or was i wrong not seeing a life without you or taking eerything that you said at face value you packed up and left dude i was so glad shouldve questioned how you easily became a nomad if i could do it all again it wouldntve happened so fast and it burns with every line jotted in this notepad cause at first you resembled my twin fast forward you gave me identical twins but then you lost it honestly that murked my soul cause though we wadnt tryna have one we got off the birth control and we was right back at it fucking like addicts while you was disrupting what was seeming like a marriage you never got embarrassed interrogating me but that was just yaris yeah we beef and i dragged you off the bed i swear to this day i re-enact it in my head so i hemmed you up wasnt what i aimed to do i aint attack you bitch i was restraining you but you was wifey though i understand that its not a game can you imagine my surprise when the cops came handcuffed me you pressed charges but i made bail its just heartless you cant smash my laptop on the wall and then think i wasnt gonna react scratch that i mean you cant call my mom like can i crash at your spot whattup when im her son and you just locked me up but wait this is when it really gets deep judge says she get control of the house for a week filed a restraining order so she couldnt come near me the fuck else i do but go right back to tahiry im sleeping on her couch not discussing shit staring at the fattest ass not fuckin it i guess despite everything that she showed me it felt good to be around a broad that really knows me i missed all our arguin and yappin percocets and muscle relaxers in a napkin cant believe that it happened why i lost my unborn daughter when we fought im thinking i killed aspen and thats when i thought that wed be dead awhile {chuckles} but we decided to reconcile so hungover from love and what not how could you not expect us to take another shot but during all this time we dont live together stupid me thought youd go get your shit together you know get a job or if actings your career seems youve pursued the shit for a year from right here and it appears along with all the yelling and the screaming we both at the table but my side is leaning but rather than end it we tried to mend it fuck bein a couple lets work on a friendship but then it got weird i was stunned from that you took it to a place where there was no coming back off my last break up i was able to stomach that two weeks removed and you fuckin with a running back life is in shambles disguised as a damsel lies are a handful bouncing off of different guys lookin scrambled despised how it was handled but when you aint got a dime why not decide to gamble said youd be in l.a. doing business im thinking thats great i cant fault her said youd be with jennifer the whole time but you probly didnt think that i would call her she said she aint seen you since you landed and for days she been blowing up your phone like a stalker and all i could do is laugh at myself as i thought why is old girl sucking off derrick ward for said we was makin it right but you couldnt was on the phone i said skype but you wouldnt the puzzle starts coming together and its brutal wont skype gmail chat wont oovoo the whole time im noticing you actin unusual and i cant figure out who the fuck you being true to nah said the wi-fi was down in the tele but you aint say you was at hotel his house lookin like a groupie or maybe i misunderstood when you said yall two was makin a movie looking at the shit pile i stepped in again and to top it off your hoe ass is pregnant again not again i been through the world so i suck it up its less about the lie more about the cover-up so you busted but you addin to the friction cause you deny it all but you do it with conviction so you talkin to me real disparaging so what attitude coming off arrogant if i wanted a trophy wife then you could be but all it look like is that you renting out pussy less about you nah you aint the one you grown you got choices im worried bout your son thats what got me up being an insomniac little nigga cant control how his mommy act as for me im tryin flush you out my system so i counter by filming all my sexual encounters mentally not there while im screwing and i only keep going cause thats what your doing im tryna see hows it done hows it possible enough to put a weak nigga in a hospital starin at one ex talking about another but this one would kill if it meant i wouldnt suffer but she taking little shots im getting ridiculed cause all she complained about i went and did with you said she knew it wouldnt last when i lived with you shes not your type she aint got the right hips for you so you try and take somein for pain it dont work you still feel it all the novocaine dont work nope so we good i dont let it get me down not a pussy that good nor a titty that round for anything to work yall trust is a must and i learned gotta let a mutt be with a mutt so i dead that bitch and though the shits been over some situations dont end without closure  "], "joe budden & esther baxter": [" so what do you think is happening i
