{"kanye west": ["  bro. bro. listen to the kids. jeremy i need i gotta put it down for a second. its beautiful. jeremy scotts design.  first of all thank you taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award this evening thank you. and i can think back to the first day i met you also. you know. i think about when im in the grocery store with my daughter and i have a really great conversation about fresh juice and you know. and at the end they say oh youre not that bad after all. and like i think about it sometimes. like it crosses my mind a bit like when i go to a baseball game. and um sixty thousand people boo me. crosses my mind a little bit. and i think if i had to do it all again what would i have done  would i have worn a leather shirt would i have drank a half a bottle of hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience yall know yall drink that bottle too. if i had a daughter at that time would i have went on stage and grab the mic from someone elses you know this arena tomorrow its gonna be a completely different set up some concert something like that. this stage will be gone after that night the stage is gone but the effect that it had on people remain.  the the problem was the contradiction the contradiction is i do fight for artists but in that fight i somehow was disrespectful to artists. i-i didnt know how to say the right thing. the perfect thing. i just i sat at the grammys and saw justin timberlake and cee-lo lose. gnarls barkley and the future-love... sexyback album and bro\u2026.justin i aint tryna put you on blast but i saw that man in tears bro. you know and i was thinking like he deserve to win album of the year.  and this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. how could you explain that sometimes i feel like you know all this shit they run about beef and that sometimes i feel like i died for an artists opinion for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. im not no politician bro. and look at that you know how many times mtv ran that footage again cause it got them more ratings you know how many times they announced taylor was gonna give me the award cause it got them more ratings listen to the kids bro  i still dont understand award shows i dont understand how they get five people who work their entire life won sold records sold concert tickets to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. i dont understand it bro. i dont understand when the biggest album or the biggest video i still dont understand it i been conflicted bro i just wanted people to like me more. but fuck that bro  two thousand and fifteen. i will die for the art for what i believe in and the art aint always gonna be polite. yall might be thinking right now i wonder did he smoke something before he came up here the answer is yes i rolled up a little something i knocked the edge off. i dont know whats gonna happen tonight i dont know whats going to happen tomorrow bro.  but all i can say to my artists my fellow artists just worry how you feel at the time man just worry about how you feel and dont never you know what im saying im confident i believe in myself. we the millennials bro this is a new this is a new mentality. we not gonna control our kids with brands. were not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids were gonna teach our kids that they can be something. we gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. we gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. if my grandfather was here right now he would not let me back down.  i dont know what im finna lose after this. it dont matter though it aint about me its about ideas. people with new ideas. people who believe in truth.  and yes as you probably could have guessed by this moment i have decided in 2020 to run for president.
