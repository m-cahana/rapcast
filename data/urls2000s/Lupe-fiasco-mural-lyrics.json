{"lupe fiasco": [" were all chemicals vitamins and minerals vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm to see the vein like a chicken on the barn top cat chat lets begin another yarn thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm but roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy so what powers cowards to get them to the top just to fall asleep listening to bach the ribbon in the sky is the riddim that i drop dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock that lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading they catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling and whats the talking without the match feeling thats buried living and cherry picking every lemon from your berry system then proceed with the pack feeding when i was young i had visions of another world sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother hurl incense smoke made vortices and other curls casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls i like my pancakes cut in swirls moroccan moles and undercover squirrels i like cartoons southern cities with large moons faith healers ex-female drug dealers and art booms apologize for my weird mix what taste like hot dogs and tear drips and looks like pantomime and clear bricks and smells like shotguns and deer piss they on their hunt kind of salty that im going hard first part of a party that i throw in parts one minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts but thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars i run the gambit like im throwing cards from popular mechanics to overdosing hearts paint cold pictures like nova scotia landscapes nerd gang make mandelbrot sets when we handshake a word game back up plan that can dam lakes backup the wordplay playing at the mans states means i can still be the man if the dam breaks and when demand brakes im reflectious what they cant face my peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base the unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine that hovers above cities like weather men and maybe weather woman whatever better to tell ya weather comin i prefer girls to reign all over the world and not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining or rein like deer slaves to santa claus sleigh man but reign like queens that reign over made man and not queen like queen killer rhapsody bohemian queen but queen like white glove wave hand and not wave hand like its a heat wave so you make a fan by waving your hand im talking wave like you saying hey man and not hay for horses and hoarse is like you almost voiceless you gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress and treat every single one of your words like reinforcements and especially when youre recording cause thats the portion thats important when i was reporting that i was poorbut now im more than poor its still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots crying shames make margarita rims from cheap tops deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots a little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop and a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop and fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box so the sun rise when the beat drops and the sun dies when the beat stops... then it unties then it relocks then it relapsed then it detox then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot cause he want what we got like yeah  then forge poetry like a young ornery morrissey then spit it to the golden locks thots who like their porridge all watery not scorching nor sorbet-y from the steel orbitings sorcerer sorcery coming down gorgeously just like a stacey dash waterfall a more torturing a water-boarding barbie doll a river of women like a brazilian carnival swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol somebody give them the volleyballs if you love her dont ever send her to mally malls homie if she lonely she might end up in macaulys claws coming out the closet over goblets down at madri gras the fame champagne walk of shame lobby call my rap position was black condition and activism ammunition for abolition missions attacking systems but theyre not apt to listen unless its dropping on activision are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions operating applications stuck inside an apple prison chicken hack and download updates that lack religion or are we more... ...than soil tainting disloyal changelings preoccupied with boy and goyle chasing and foiling others royal saintings i sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings uhhh aint nothin to it but to do it unless you virgin mary nothin do it but the truest believe all that unless you jewish life is not a dictionary its a thesaurus and i feel like a missionary to a clitoris the water bearer heir of traditions that i swear to never change my chair position or conditions of my porridge submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin forest as i perform a nerve storm i prefer my pictures in word form bury the hatchet like how a bird born as i paint cold pictures like kool-aid facing condensation having conversations with flavorful combinations slave to my concentration so thats oj da juiceman meets oj with two hands and two gloves thats too snug to judge who was who drew blood and lupe look at all these toucans in a cemetery full of tomahawks giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults road runners dont fall off cliffs they run across anomalies by the colony flukes by the reservoir wildin pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor levitating youths who know the truth of where the fountain hides buccaro roof painting tunnels onto
