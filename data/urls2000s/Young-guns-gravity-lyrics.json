{"young gunz": [" im in such awe yet such dismay the finite becomes infinite through hues of blue and grey the darkness overwhelms my eyes at first but something bright amid the black it saves me from my worst im higher than any man could say but lower than the lowest point that earth can hide from me and there she is how can i look away hope glimmers all around her but my eyes dont seem to sway  ", " you never seemed more beautiful than any time i looked before one second more i fear i may go blind i know that i should carry on but i cannot forget that warmth staring at the sun heeds warning from mankind  gravity wont let me go gravity wont let me go  ", "", "  gravity wont let me go gravity wont let me go   youll always shine no matter where you hide a piece of you reflects off all the matter floating by into the void however i may yearn where darkness will consume me until earth i shall return though night may never fall the same and day may never rise again i know the orbit you inspire will set me free i could spend another age drifting further away but i hope gravity will pull me back some day  i can see for miles away alone and so afraid of what the darkness has in store for me  i can see you start to fade along this journey i have made but i cant thank you more for lighting the way  "]}
