what a time to be alive  it was never going to be the project we hoped for\u2014after all the mixtape came together in just 6 days. thats the kind of pace at which future regularly operates. drake not so much: its tough to see someone do four five songs in one night and not try to match it. the result was a hit-and-run snapshot of strip-club rap at its absolute pinnacle. the unrestrained joy of jumpman juxtaposed with the lights-on sadness of plastic bag doesnt get any more magic city. neither artist was in album mode but the temptation to label wattba as a throwaway project would be unwise. the substance lies in the process and the result is more enjoyable than 95 percent of music released in 2015. thats really all that matters in the end. \u2014 theonlydjorkaeff 18. meek mill -
