say you the best battler in the world you aint telling the truth you studied my background aint no book that i wrote aint no footnotes your whole style is one big joke from dna to arsonal to kotd now you wanna fuck with me you must be crazy im a apex predator you a battle rap degenerate tryin to gain leverage from a high fructose beverage  ", " you get killed and ", " you fucking pussy you probably paint your pinky nails and chill with him at chippendales welcome to hell germaine the wrath is comin this is the part of the rap you get your ass confronted then i catch you in the back gettin relaxed and blunted and set the place on fire til it feels like you sittin inside of a dragons stomach you cats dont want it you get castrated and hacked in nuggets i make chicken strips out of your loved ones thats what i call a family bucket im like kfc when i pull the axe out you get slashed and gutted so fast even the king of the dot staff will need panoramic camera coverage just to capture the angles of blood back from the other side of the room when i drag you from it fuckin yelling over my shit like they always do thats some shit i already knew but whats wrong with you canibus what is it you fucked it up doing some skateboarding stuff im tryin to figure out how you ended up with your bones getting crunched but now it makes sense i get it you punched yourself in the chest so hard you made your own shoulders touch you had a fall from grace fell a long way from the praise that hes gotten to being straight misplaced and forgotten nowadays from place to place he be hoppin but he never feels safe no matter wheres at from all the names he be droppin and he keeps droppin names even after all the pain that it cost him he stays takin losses ll cool j basically stomped him the same happened with slim shady even though you initiated the problem so its safe to say after today thisll be the nail in his coffin i got infinite skill\u2026 even if you took millions and millions of pills like the kid from the film limitless you still couldnt think of shit thats this ill; im ill ridiculous chill you physically built like a little bitch your squad trippin then they all gettin killed your dogs im skinning them knitting them into a sweater quicker than cruella de vil look at this fuckin treatment im givin him look at the treatment im givin this old ass senior citizen that wouldnt be seen within the reach of 300 feet of the streets of michigan from all the nightmares and dreams of slim repeatedly rippin him i aint peter griffin so why do i beef with this chicken jabbin and kickin repeatedly until he bleeds from his ribs and then falls asleep on the concrete in the same fetal position he was left in ever since eminem beat his career in submission and didnt let him spit again blackballed and restricted him blocked him from his mission or any other business attempts so techically slim ended up stiffin him harder than he did to kim ever since the last time the bitch attempted taking half of his shit from him you a pitiful guy miserable type sucker you lived in a time cluster where it was easy for getting by cause most of the industry lines were missing those intricate rhyme structures so your lyrics to them were like mind-fuckers but as the internet winds buffered you realized its harder to keep up with these little guys cause its like a million times tougher i mean looking at him i feel like the universe just wants to witness this guy suffer cause hes going through hell and lls out in some ridiculous-priced suburb he probably lives with a white butler who every night is hired to fix him a nice supper he literally drives like 65 hummers and everyone of them is specifically a different type of color yo yall know what rhymes with germaine williams never made millions thats what it is never made millions that dude i dont know who he is but hes straight brilliant so what happend after your successive second round knock out exactly nothing happened there was no one left on earth for canibus to call out so he pretty much ran out of things to talk about the industry blocked him out and they fuckin locked him out and we didnt hear from him again til he popped up in a song calling out every single member from slaughterhouse you wouldve socked every one of them out pfft dont be mad at them because you took the hater/salty route mothafucka everybody hates your guts you called everybody out from slaughterhouse except crooked i cause crooked i wouldve stomped you out bro everybody fuckin hates you what the fuck are you talking bout we interviewed ll and even his own mama said to knock you out look at the bright side youre like a certified author now you can write a novel on what being blackballed is all about its probably all them call-outs and them blogs and why he had a falling-out its like being inside of a poolhall when watchin his ass fall cause he got ate blackballed and then they chalked him out fuck are you talking bout he wants to rap with me we all miss that canibus that used to attack with the thirst rage snap and burst like an animal thats trapped in a dirt cage but nowadays you uninspired and i can see the cracks in your wordplay youre saying aww i kept it true to hip-hop blahblahblahblah thats what the herbs say you took your ball home and went home cause things in the industry werent happening your way you wanted to become famous too you and ll were suppose to collab on the first tape but he bodybagged you off the track in the worst way then you came back and you said it wasnt about the fame its about being heard and theres a purpose to every actual verse made. but thats the impact the accurate words make cause if it was truly about the art and the lab was your workplace then you wouldve never wanted to be on a track like that in the first place i fuckin hate it when people try to go mainstream and then flip-flop and then they try to disguise their failure as them being true to hip-hop so i dont give a fuck what you got to talk about next time one of your homies pops out thats how you do a fuckin first round knock-out  ", " you fucking iranian shoe-bombing islamic math hoffin jewish bronze solomon in jesus christ name amen separated shoulder crawlin outta border control i aint have enough quarters for the toll $300 dollar bounty it took 10 days before i got out the country they was fightin all around me this is how they found me i came here to do you worse than dna did i wanted it to be no more wins for you in this battle rap biz i wanted to eat your fuckin heart two chambers at a time cause maybe after that youll understand the danger of the rhyme gravity is a repulsion not an attraction when it comes to lyrics i used to be the living bruce lee in action counter-psychological measures reduce the pressure whos better that mothafucka never its gonna take a lot more than him to make can-i-bus a believer man i thought you was gonna walk out with justin bieber i never met a battler that act like stan so much he wanna be marshall so bad he put up bread to battle can-i-bus tell em you hang out with elton john in lebanon when eminems gone so both of yall can massage rupauls balls are you a faggot or a faggot magnet why the fuck are you so obsessed with eating rappers asses what are you dizaster are you an iranian monkey trainer a

mema-se mama-sa mama-makusa i put a tattoo of you on treachs arm right next to 2pac  ", " yo thats not what i would call diz see diz is something different a faggot nigga tryin to make a living off of dissin he walk around spittin battle raps like he ill but he cant avoid the fact yeah he do got skills 2012 i still spit that shit real niggas feel why does 99% of you resemble madd illz too late wipe

lookin at me for ali drive this aint no regular battle this about your intellectual power a cold blooded disrespect for an hour genocide by drone strike dizasters bones in a cave he in the strone age playing cee-lo with stone dice god put me here to eat shit and die but when i made the infinite rhyme he changed his mind but you you just a funny guy with peanut-butter brown honey eyes; when i look into the windows of your soul i dont see much inside thats why right here right now june 9th 06/06 canibus gonna prove that dizaster aint shit ayo i stick dick to your moms build a nuclear bomb and put it in her thong i rediscovered hip-hop with my infinite rhyme ill even put the president back in office one more time i charge oprahs credit card and tell barack to go long for another 90 yards

dont you still live with your moms thats right dick in your mouth parents had to kick you out the house after that you moved in with your spouse i cant tell if you a deadbeat dad or a red meat fag or a greasy ass nasty piece of lebanese trash  #  "], "dizaster": [" yo whatever yall expecting from me today think the reversal of that today every single verse that i rap is gonna have zero personal attacks ima use the science and math and shit that you teachin and ima murk you with that no personals no jokes just lyricism cause hip-hop has always been like that so anything he says to me intellectual ima be able to flip right back i can teach yall how to chemically break down an enzyme flat stabilize the temperature using incubators which condense molecules that turns into h2o you can get right back cause when particles\u2026 wait a minute yall thought i was gonna come out here and spit some stupid shit like that ayo let me get this fuckin word off fuckin faggot brought all of his homies with him he hasnt even got his verse off and this little fucking homo already got his shirt off you wanna shit the ", " metal jackets you pathetic faggot i will stomp you to death im a fuckin hustler so when i be callin people you know i call to collect but when canibus be calling people you know he be callin collect see you wanna talk the talk out here just deposit the check cause if not im gonna fuckin stomp you to death see out in the east you can talk that talk but if you talk that talk in the west you leave like flava flav just another skinny little black faggot gettin clocked in his chest then he said im like slim shady im tryin to be slim shady just for saying that youre gonna end up demolishing yourself bro that whole part you were talking about i didnt know if you were referring to me or talking about yourself cause aint nothing worse in the world than that track that you did with stan what was it the four horsies you guys got back together back in scribble jam or was it at the rap olympics fam either way nobody fucking gives a damn aye listen bro i pull it out and i snap it and click and bam kinda like my gat already had an app for instagram this motherfucker wants to take my ass to dizneyland sorry dad ima scratch that because i have a different plan how bout i take you to the ranch in neverland and put you in a casket quicker than a thousand miligrams of michael jacksons diprivan fucker thought he was gonna come back and kill me man this motherfucker canibus sucks besides all it took back in the day was two ls and a cool j to roll canibus up and since we in cali ima pour magazines in him thats what i call a canibus cup but im just clownin with you you obviously a mark dont make this clown shit an issue ill rip your body apart ill fire rounds from the pistol my shells are like the red ones from mario kart cause they follow you around til they hit you my guns gon feel like a merry-go-round once they gainst you cause they gonna lift you four horsies off the ground and then spin you thats some crazy shit whenever you reach the top lets say right now you can fuckin take me on yeah ive already got this region locked bro i am the king of the dot you ooh\u2026 let me teach you something bruh let me teach you how to keep the spot you couldnt cause your value in it would decrease the stock but this aint 2000 bc i guess he forgot mothafucka you shouldnt even talk; his old ass is probably still sitting here waiting for the beat to drop youre not even sharp at least not enough for me not enough for this league i mean what good is marching on soft sand when you dont have strong enough feet to walk on concrete and your schemes are not built up to par with the top tiers we got man you should take it a little easy pops cause youre gettin a lil old and out here people speed a lot proceed with caution there aint no beat in this arena to cover up your cheesy bars i can visibly see your flaws allowing me to use them as a weakness that im feeding off but the leading cause of beef thats caused between us is a missing link of not being able to think or ever be evolved see its easy to see why he dissolved because hes a subspecies so even though everything were taught to believe revolves around us being engineered human beings were clearly not because seeing people like him breathin are the real reasons i dont believe in god and if theres like a one in a fucking six billion chance that my theorys wrong i put my cheese up on it that this idiot would completely defeat the odds you aint a thief that robs people cause you evil dog you a thief that robs people cause you need a job you wanna eat then i beat you over the head with a piece of beef kabob and let you bleed across the street from ross the same place you faggots buy your t-shirts off homie i will kill you as soon as the fucking needle drops run outside and have my homies let the heater off and blood will be fillin up the street like it was cedar block youre not strong enough to top your peak just face it youve aged and youve gotten weak you can no longer keep on pace with todays top elites not a cappella or on a beat. stop blogging please if not at least while you still got a spot to keep you used to be a role model to all these geeks; even gangstas looked up to you like when a respected father speaks see the problem is to hip-hop you are unique thats why it also bothers me cause i feel like im putting my own dog to sleep watchin the karma seep watchin him burn alive from the inside as the karma seeps from your eyes onto your rotten cheeks cause the canibus we used to know now is a shallow surface thats far from deep and all thats left for you at the end is the nightmares that haunt your sleep along with the psychological scars you keep as a product of the karma youve gotten from fucking over all your peeps so i dont give a fuck homie i get my g on im a real mc mothafuckas i get my free on so it makes sense that this mothafucka here has this stupid ass sling on cause hes never been a good shoulder to lean on  \u2026  ", "", "   yo let me just end this fuckin battle if anymore of this shits gonna get postponed this mothafuckas mad at me cause hes always gettin his ho boned he said i live at home with my parents youre right im 28 and i live in a crib that i dont own but that makes me more qualified to smoke canibus because ive always been home-grown dont be mad though you lost to the mvp i will always still be the best emcee im just mad at you because i took all this time to prepare and you fuckin disrespected me you disrespected me like you disrespected all you disrespected pharoahe monch you disrespected wyclef you hated on em all anybody doing more than you you preyed and you waited on their fall thats why i aint speakin for me ima say this for us all thats why hip-hop has forsaken you and here you dont deserve a place at all but in the restroom next to the toilet hanging by the stall but you dont even deserve to hang there either cause i can still find more appreciation on the piss stains that are on the wall you had a legendary cypher with dmx big pun and mos def my dude yeah that shit is true we seen it online it got plenty of views but the problem with that is that you said you deserved to go last out of all of them what makes you think you credible or even legible to cause 10 years have passed and the evidence proved that them three did more for hip-hop individually than you ever could do so i dont want you to get mad let this just be a lesson to you; to act selfish in a cypher is something thats hella self-centered to do but youre canibus\u2026 its okay you get a pass cause its expected from you you think youre bigger than pun pun is a legend my dude hes a worldwide icon thats sold more records and hes more respected than you you youre just a homeless man on the corner holdin a can beggin for food just accept it youre through accept that you were never accepted instead you just do some extra reckless shit and just prove you will always be a liability to anybody thats invested in you just ask wyclef hell tell you like the rest of them dudes your album flopped when it dropped so you stabbed him in the back because you couldnt get it to move when you shouldve said thank you to him cause hes the one that helped you improve wassup m80 where you at you pathetic jew together you are like fucking tumors in the business that needs to get removed everyone that you ever did business with to help your music in the end is getting screwed yourself included what about all the efforts and attempts that you did to get us sued because some shit in the contract was left excluded yeah dont believe nothing hes saying if you do then your heads polluted; this is why hes a disrespectful piece of shit and hes getting executed i dont wanna hear about how ur presence helps the movement; its more like an infection to it you aint here for us youre here to fuckin sell some units how you gonna help us when you havent even showed no sign of self-improvement just the same old pathetic under-developed human who never went through evolution i mean this dude is stone age why try to relate with him i should go on myspace to find him a primate to go on a blind date with him cause in his mindstate that would be the prime mate for him hes a chrome magnum man a homosapien bipedal and shell with the brain missin the way that he reacts he has strange thinkin the way he displays rhythm hes so ancient i cant even communicate with him its like he has the most important strand of dna missin so it has nothing to do with racism when i say i see the ape in him ill stab you in your fuckin eyes with a giant identical set of forks to poseidons or the type of forks that lucifer pitches inside of the fires in hell that scorch when im rhyming im at the center core of a high-pressure reservoir of eternal fire thats strong enough to survive behind heavens door and if you stay alive ima keep firin with the rifle like im tryin to set the record storm your body will show up at a fuckin beach somewhere dead you can finally rest a shore/assure this mothafucka has spent his whole life on a message board hes always on the net; this guys like a tennis court i mean the crease above your eyes look like vinyl record warps you look like some time of kenyan dwarf collided with a virally infected i am legend corpse spliced with the fuckin dna of the alien from splice or some other type of genetic source that was developed directly inside of the umbrella corp you killed the crowd no one wants to even react no more what you actin like a fuckin faggot for so ima end it with this last scheme\u2026 everything that he did was toally fucking wack and was overhyped your fucking deposit for this battle was totally overpriced but its worth it knowing that we can go home at night knowing some lunatic named germaine williams doenst own the rights cause if he did he would probably attach the footage to the back of a radioactive protocol device or something else that completely never existed like his military soldier stripes who gives a fuck if so and so sold their soul for ice youre becoming more of an attention whore with every metaphor you write this motherfuckers terrified of anybody thats 59 cause it reminds him of royces height when you get killed in a battle youre supposed to fight what are you like 40 right all you did was burn bridges like usher youre the corny type you blackballed yourself into the horizon with benzino riding with you on the back of the motorbike have you seen that tattoo on his arm ll hates him of course hes hype this motherfucker couldnt beat him in a battle so he turned around and literally stole his mic so how the fuck are you gonna call j. cole j. clone callin him a clone despite knowing that the only tat on your arm showing aint even your own prototype homie its over go home goodnight you wanna threaten ll and show up to the video with mike but were all thinking of course you roll with mike you and him are both alike cause judging by that tattoo both you faggots were born to bite yeah so hes gonna talk about how i choked and didnt own the fucking moment right hell probably mention some shit he didnt but ima still own him right ayo this motherfucker shouldnt be mad at me cause im the one who helped him walk back toward the light im the one that showed him what real hope is like yeah im the one that gave him a chance after the industry already disowned him twice they fuckin left him they controlled his life so i dont give a fuck if i choked up in a battle or if i froze that night cause canibus over here fuckin choked in life nobody wants to hear anymore so ima shoot to this fuckin faggot ill pull out a bazooka and shoot him while hes moving through traffic im an islamic suicidal cuckoo fanatic ill put canibus in a box and ll cool js a faggot  "]}
