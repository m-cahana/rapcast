{"joe budden": ["  can anybody pinpoint the day it went wrong i mean i used to blame reggaeton i cant front i thought all that was corny was it jas fault lil mo said she aint get paid for put it on me look you bring it up and dudes get on some coy shit was it t-pain with that funny voice shit or was it lil wayne with that funny voice shit the whole game dick rode that funny voice shit i cant tell when it happened was it when lil jon showed dudes you could sell without rapping was it laffy taffy i thought they was kiddin shawty lo said dey know i really didnt dancin became cool again then came walk it out but i aint know what the fuck niggas was talkin bout unit kicked game out they aint give a fuck then we see the same shit happen to buck it was a few years ago but i remember the summer 50 made fans start looking at the numbers a&rs wont take risks they wont sign niggas the word swag came out and started to blind niggas rap dudes want reality shows and my dumbass was thinking that reality sold did it start with the ipod or when rappers had to pay djs for them to do their job now all the content is the same it dont differ everybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers the more you think about you gonna just get sicker i mean why the fuck would nas wanna call his shit nigga nigga was it when the wu broke up pac b.i.g. pun went to sleep never woke up lupe was doing a tribute and choked up some of these stupid ass fans was like so what some them they aint educated fuck blaming the south we aint segregated i mean it was all good around the kiss and beans shit took a left turn around the kiss and green shit maybe it all started when roc-a-fella parted ways its natural to shift toward fame i watched every last one of dudes shit on dame kind of got that in common i can dig that pain when they gave jay a desk and suit they finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute but somethin told me the suits at the tables was hurtin they fired everybody labels started merging far as sales the decline is strong as the experts theyll say that the climates wrong i mean some niggas prime is gone i peeped it when niggas started puttin fake diamonds on you can tell a dude i spit better than you but then hell say im richer for whatever i do i seen all this coming i knew what we was in for back when erick sermon had jumped out of the window was it when ma$e retired he couldnt hack it tip could he just needed some more ratchets djs producers the ones who get us the farthest said fuck rappers and they became the artists i gotta talk candid did we start having issues around the same time jimmy and cam did or was it when chingy thought he aint need ludacris his next album found out that that was ludicrous papoose and clipse both survived inking with jive then getting jived your man jae hood repped that d-block gang then i seen dude dragging his d-block chain or did one-hit wonders change it all along they made labels only want to sign a dudes song and you really dont know shit if you think the fans pick the videos on 106 im just stating the truth did it start when fox stayed in the news more than she did the booth or was it when lil kim stopped exploiting sex the fuck is up with dmx i hope dudes straight have an opinion and they gonna say you hate i cant front im missing the old clue tapes next thing the underground sunk further the feds was on irv so the inc dropped murder i never blame fab jeezy rick ross did shit get lost when shyne went up north ill never understand the hiphop police when hiphop is what hiphop needs to police these blatant-ass radio attempts sound so bland twista kept trying to recreate slow jamz then we send the wrong message with our slang broke niggas blowing they rent to make it rain so you walk in and give a bitch a few $20\u2032s shell smerk her face up looking at you funny this chick told me she only take new money man i snatched my shit back sooo fast or did it start when rappers said fuck it sacrificed music and started raping they budget nothing wrong with dudes being candy or pop something was wrong when joc did the candy shop we buying our own records maybe no ones to blame are we a business that we cant afford to maintain second week show that boy numbers aint high i hate to break it to you numbers always lie or when ortiz signed to aftermath and now hes feeling the aftermath was it fight klub fucking with them battle raps not too many of them gettin signed after that i mean some cant stay afloat a million busta albums hes still not mentioned with the goats fuck looking for answers time will tell was it when def jam didnt want to resign l a 15-year old told me cass was ass rather than spazz all dude could do was laugh or was it when the whole east coast fell off or got comfortable maybe dudes was too well off the more niggas said they didnt write down lyrics the more it started to sound like they didnt but do whatever you can to keep the lights on but dumbin down just became the new dylan honestly i aint know what to think a few years ago we had the young kids wearing pink i cant blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing when we trained them to be this way i mean showed em whatever to sell with no limits since the early 90\u2032s sold em a false image so when some shit comes that dont fit the mold its like mole and nigga you wont even do gold they watch the videos see you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you hood they turn on the tv see these video bitches and they think niggas girls really look that good i mean they get so many free verses when the album drops the shits more like a bonus why pay for it why take onus with one click of the mouse they could own it  i mean some of them are fooled so easily by whatever we say or we show em on tv but that was all part of the plan or was it when eminem made stan i swear some of these fans they put they whole life on the line its like they cant like more than one rapper at a time less about the product more about the digits its a business we got less fans and more critics maybe we at a cross canibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost and i aint believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me that krs-one had a rap beef with nelly if rap was alive wed be trying to be the best rappers ever not the best rapper alive but you wont get accepted at all if you aint street tough onyx was the hardest til sticky got beat up now im a thug is how i gotta behave if i wanna be paid if i wanna see praise you know somethings wrong when niggas are getting shot and you gotta sit and wonder if the whole things staged it aint real no more or did we just expand on our audience maybe we appeal to more or do we think yall are just getting dumber we tried to make gettin older getting younger did we lose our hunger somethings gotta give did we outgrow ourselves is hiphop for kids if it is they turn on mtv cribs and think thats where these motherfuckers really live or was it when lauryn hill dropped a classic so did the fugees til wyclef tapped it songs dont do it no more the shits shocking seen it when lean back had the whole world rocking now its fuck your bars if your hook is fly so we look at crooked i with a crooked eye dope ass rappers aint seeing no dough if everythings commercial where the fuck is the show but anybody making a dime see ima wish well still we took a big l losing big l or was it when youtube came in the game now nobodys from their living room can make a name or when indies like koch came and blew up niggas at the majors they literally threw up to some it aint fun no more you know its fucked up when dmc dont talk to run no more to many egos like we aint one no more shits predictable niggas aint stunned no more we startin to see shit we never seen before at one point we even had the magazines at war or was it street dvds like smack showed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act this shit get lifeless when mtv made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest changed the whole steelo i mean the averaged fan never heard of goodie mob or a cee lo but they heard of gnarls barkley and dr. carter still say we got a heartbeat i aint gonna lie i was scared to death straight up i started to hear rumors of an outkast breakup i was like that aint true it sounds desperate then started to see big boi and 3k separate we had periods where it was drier than a desert are we all killin this shit is it a group effort are we alive and well or barely surviving is it r&bs fault them niggas is thriving then a lot of people go and blame limewire i dont think its downloadin dog the lines tired did the fans just get tired of the outcome one dope single and a bullshit album so they share albums with each other was it master p with them ugly ass album covers or when we started appearing in the news timberland said they didnt want black niggas wearing they boots i mean i know it got foggy at least blurry when the label dude got knocked out by keith murray or was it when we became obsessed with the brand names had the kids trying to buy shit they cant name and some think the evidence is ample did it start when puff took advantage of the sample is it all watered down with no fire if you had enough money you can buy a ghostwriter or the diamond district with jacob the jeweler had to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler fucking with them trends our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that aint even in look is the game now as bad as its ever been its not ringtones just the songs that they represent i heard all of em the sad part i wouldnt recognize most these niggas if i saw em i cant explain it i dont know what to tell ya now goin gold is look at as a failure maybe old heads in charge just werent able djs is spinning now with no turntable maybe the fans are just bored of us or maybe there aint enough room for all of us its like even a friendship will stop at a point mike jones went platinum off of slim thugs joint but theres so many ways to get fuckin rich supahead caked off by just suckin dick did we sell out just to get in demand more did we go against everything we used to stand for both are likely theres two sides to a coin who you rollin with: souljah boy or ice-t some niggas wanna sit around and complain about i rather analyze seek how it came about if we could rewind the world we wouldnt have to watch flava flav try to find his girl look today its all about marketing and promo i remember vh1 was just for old folks but no maam if i aint know better i would think that mix show is now programmed we let the power of the dollar annihilate us now the size of our chain gonna validate us its too simple they cant think were really deep i just heard chris brown on the a millie beat seen a video its called lookin ass niggas grabbed the remote tired of lookin at niggas but that let a nigga know if we aint dead then we just half alive maybe brain dead did it start when capone left nore nah he went to jail thats a whole different story  or maybe somethings really wrong with our ears obie trice got dropped so much for cheers female emcees they dont ever hit the target somebody said they saw amil working in a target the sad part is we already lost remy or did we go wrong when e-v-e got skinny whats up with jacki-o rah digga that i cant figure and trina aint been the same since nan nigga i know it had to do something to his heart beat when lady of rage started doing steve harvey i know we caught a lil trama somewhere between yo yo boss and lil mama lot of females found another way to extort most of our video models have turned escort do anything to see dough so theyll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role or should we get back to basics wheres the rakims or the master aces the big daddy kanes or did we never recover from dre not being on the side of ed lover or when rap dude started signin their friends instead of going out and tryin to find niggas with skill seen it happen when d-12 put out purple pills and while the whole hood laughed them niggas sold a mil some of us aint prepared for something so lucrative i just heard yung berg say some stupid shit like we almost caught one in the torso when each bone thugs member took they own crossroads some disagree some gotta see the same or maybe hip hop died on aailyahs plane if it relocated where did it move to i still love h.e.r. the way common used to or did bill o reily come fuck up the spirit with negative remarks about everybodys lyrics spend all this time dissin us nigga you 95 years old motherfucker shouldnt be a listener lost jam master who was tougher then leather or did it start when treach started fuckin pepa as our jeans got tighter and our tees got longer im trying to figure which age group we belong to or did we all go astray the second dr. dre left n.w.a. i mean in my opinion we was on easy street when he was beefin with eazy-e or did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat signin unknown niggas to start making their beats if you sell your own shit it gotta go for cheap put my name on it and the price increase or is it cause everybodys so self-centered is that the reason hip hop itself aint centered or have we already seen this shit with our own eyes rico suave hammer and vanilla ice everybody want in the game so in return you got label executives fuckin their interns and anybody lookin at that new vibe bracket should see that they dont know a thing about this rap shit or maybe we shoulda stopped being proud when there was no more rawkus and no more loud tried to get conscious around vote or die so they made it look like all our votes was lies as the years go on its like we keep gettin more voids we got lost when we lost one of the lost boys i knew we was impersonating a fraud when kay-slay smacked my man at the awards regardless its our fault as artists runnin with entourages who act like they aint never left the projects who do we wanna target will they put an uncle murda cd in a wal-mart or a target we got the nerve to not wanna hear ras kass but fuck with v.i.c. get silly and that trash i felt ashamed when j-kwon told me he aint like raekwon cause he stole his name was back when everybody in the club got tipsy now every contract gotta be 360 so fuck eatin better scrape the plate now every beat gotta at least have an 808 did the lights get dim when we first heard mims and said another new york rapper on the south tip is it overcrowded they keep sayin if its so fucked up then do something about it i doubt it theres just one thing they dont understand that job is way bigger then just one man or maybe all of these pleas that its deceased is false and its right where it needs to be maybe we built on something thatll last forever see face and geto boys just got back together maybe no one can stop us even other genres now jock us we even doing songs with the rockers how is that the feelin kanyes amazin wayne just sold a million we closer to a ceilin how are we in a coma when we the only business you can excel without a diploma technology changed made everything simple myspace is now a dudes bio slash demo aside from this rap we generatin more money we took it global and penetrated other countries so lets celebrate sip some cris some more shit we embrace just to end up dissed go and buy the bar out so we can all get bent lets go and cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent or heres another bright idea to entertain lets go and put our face on the bottom of a chain are some of us just nigga rich with nigga money while jews keep laughin look at these nigga dummies should hip hop be a steppin stool till we find another role we can step into some of us doin movies as a matter of fact and some never stopped to plan life after rap i mean as a whole did we stop movin further around the time snoop dogg went on trial for murder or was it scarface creatin these clonies 30 years later everybodys still tony maybe anybody complaining is deranged can you expect something to grow and not change were socially accepted deviated our old route to simplify the term we all sold out i think i figured out whos to blame started out obama ended up mccain so we kurt cobaind ourself and were defeated so next time they ask who killed it tell em we did  "]}
