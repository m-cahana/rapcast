{"canibus": [" yo why is the ripper so ill that would be an unpardonable breach of confidence for me to reveal he said one of these days all eyes would be on me when they look up in the sky and see the neon c rhymes inscribed on a nickel disk encased in glass with an ion beam for longevity for more than ten centuries impressions and memories the first time-machine inventor will mention me canibus was a visionary indeed he believed light could travel in multiples of c the organic supercomputer that solved the mysteries of klein kaluza with two blue metric rulers liked cool j but thought stephen jay gould was cooler and he never liked to propagate rumors smoked canary island cigars liked american luxury cars and beautiful asian broads he had a strong mind he used to philosophize about rhymes while he was pruning his bonsai he claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time but he would never take it out his archives he wrote two songs per day and was constantly experimenting with his wordplay in his youth he did a report on the sloan digital sky survey he got an f but he deserved an a i followed his career from the first day it seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways i seen him pull in twenty-four hour workdays with deferred pay undeterred by the word shame public humiliation was the worst pain he was spinning out of control like a class 5 hurricane he said he wouldnt want another mc to suffer the same especially when theres nothing to gain he was the illest alive but nobody would face it he spit till his tongue was too torched to taste it properly funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations to extract the information they found it utterly amazing they claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting never mattered to him that art galleries hated him cause thomas kinkade called and said he would take ten complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language with sound but without shape or signature kept files in his garage on ms-dos in a fire-proof pod we thought it was odd outside there was a shed with an oppenheimer lock he apparently kept more wax then madame tussauds we were in total awe cause it blew our minds so many rhymes that were intricately designed he was poet laureate of his time and if you dont mind id like to share some of his rhymes alone in my room looking through the 32x telescope zoom adjusting the focus of the moon one should not assume the philosophy of david hume is nothing more then a subjective conclusion what is the maximum field rate application the runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin affects the population fluctuation on a continuous basis but thats just the basics the juxtaposition of canibus position the precision of something no other has written way above and beyond what was intended the unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence you didnt go to college obviously i can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology a remarkable odyssey the rhymes of modern speeds when the brain orders the body not to breathe your competency is not up to speed youre not in my league you couldnt possibly be hotter then me or oppositely your minus twenty-five degrees youd squeeze but the condensation makes rifle barrels freeze allow me to speak figuratively nigga please my intellectual properties are about the size of greece your counselor advised you not to speak my counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat in the words of joseph heller i learned how to write better even though it sort of irked me he said he didnt understand the process of the imagination but he felt he was at its mercy which explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces the reason why nobodys probably ever heard of me couldnt understand what i mean by ill unless you try to translate what i print to film this is the line of reel the circle of time the cycle of eternity the emergence of one line academic phonetics render critics tongue-tied ive personified dry humor of cum laude alumni a wise man sees failure as progress a fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic and loses his soul in the process obsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content my style is masterful multilateral i could battle a fool and be naturally cruel words of scorn are a disastrous tool from an existentialists view im a better rapper than you grab the mic and rip your physical fabric in two my attitude is fucked up but admirable different methods interpreted into different forms from entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms not just spitting a poem theres much more involved theres much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve forty-eight orders of mechanical laws and rays of creational cause enhance the cadence of my bars maybe i am self-absorbed but thats the effect to find the cause you should ask my a&r today is what it is but only because yesterday was what it was permitting you heard of beelzebub a tale of demons and drugs pissy drunk in the club with the dj doing the needle rub chances are youll never see me son yeah i know my names canibus but i cant help you if you need a dub i came to holla at some big booty bitches and listen to the speakers thump where you get conceited from im so nice on the mic they wanna beat me up its deep as fuck i aint seen it all but ive seen enough really unbelievable stuff theres a lot of times when i want to speak but im stuck i should leave this rap shit alone and kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home my imagination is my own the liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone with a pen in my hand i bring motion to the enneagram and become can-i millenium man engrave my back with the emperors stamp been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began trying to escape the wicked empire of def jam and the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang every warrior has an axe to bury but he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary i said to myself germaine this is insane its suicide its controlled flight into terrain i fought to regain control of the plane but went up in a ball of flames and got banned from the hip-hop hall of fame for two bars i kept hearing in my head over and over again it cost me everything im convinced now that more than the truth is at stake where people create language that pretends to communicate euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes but its a byproduct of the ghetto music we make from an extroverted point of view i think its too late hip hop has never been the same since 88 since it became a lucrative profession theres a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression even though the potency of it lessens big money industries writing checks to suppress the question and nobody gives a fuck no more no one goes to the book store ever since the confluence of moores law but i stay in the lab like niels bohr and his son aage edward lorenz and leo szilard lyrically i took rap music and turned the knob to the right full throttle and added panache why would i argue with my own conscience over the truth thats like me telling myself dont tell me what to do dialyses and analyses of battle mcs sometimes i say things i myself cant believe my lyrical is so skillfully elliptical i can understand how it makes you miserable you wonder why i never let you play your beats for me or why i keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy you wonder whats my infatuation with alicia keys canibus why dont you speak to me yo i meant it when i said no one can shine on a song that features me thats why i said it so vehemently you need to replace the hate with respect im probably the best yet poet
