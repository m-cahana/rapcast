{"young gunz": ["  i am a wavering candle light i remain but im ever slight through all my years i sit in my room in the fading light righting back all my wrongs tonight cos im still here _ boarded up all the doors and i swallowed all the keys im still haunted by all the things ill never be  to live is to learn oh the hearts a heavy burden so i take i dont wait nothing ever is for certain and i hold my hands up high on my knees tonight ill take wont wait i will live and learn my lesson here tonight _ i never knew it could be so cold but i burnt all the things i used to hold so dear still i fight with my pen in my hand held tight writing protest songs tonight cos im still here _ boarded up all the doors and i swallowed all the keys im still haunted by all the things ill never be _ to live is to learn oh the hearts a heavy burden so i take i dont wait nothing ever is for certain and i hold my hands up high on my knees tonight ill take wont wait i will live and learn my lesson here tonight  ill get off my knees and fight kick down the doors let in the light tonight tonight  "]}
