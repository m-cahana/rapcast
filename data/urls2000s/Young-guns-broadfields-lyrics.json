{"young gunz": ["  i used to hear the melody the voice of the unknown the rhythm in the rain beating down my window now its clear to me and i can see through each and every pane that i grew up and i forgot how to feel that way again  ive been lost by the city drowned by the sea ive been up on the rooftops still im caving in you can scream bloody murder loud as you want im not listening now  sing me something to bring me down cos i cant find anything like that sound i dont need it any more i left my heart back in the broad fields  used to look between the fences my hands out to the breeze i swore that i would understand the whispers in the trees  but the older i got the more i found i lost now im run through with rot covered in frost i have wandered so long and now that im here i just want to go home  sing me something to bring me down cos i cant find anything like that sound i dont need it any more i left my heart back in the broad fields  rain rain rain carry me home wash away the pain blame shame that ive come to know  rain rain rain carry me home wash away the pain blame shame that ive come to know  i think that its time yes i think that its time that i went home  "]}
