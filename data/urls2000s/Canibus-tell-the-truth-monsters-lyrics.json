from christina aguilera.  the seven tracks she was hype he was all cheesy and smiling.  he was happy about it.  he charged me 40 gs for the track we was gonna do.  eloise cut you the check sent you your first half scheduled the studio time.  i came up to d & d dirty ass d & d.  first day he was an hour late second day he was two hours late third day he was three hours late fourth day he was four hours late.  come on man tell the truth. when i stepped to you asked you yo tomorrow are you gonna be are you gonna be five hours late tomorrow you say yo my bad bis i had to move my mother out of the house.  so i say all right just call man just call and let me know what youre doing you busy so i dont have to wait for you.  so i dont have to wait in the studio because i got shit to do.  everybody got shit to do around 5 oclock in the evening.  come on now.  i dont know what it is man.   niggas bringing up some shit from 14 years ago.   like that shit is current news like its important now.  whats important now hows that important  look how many times we work together since then or how many times i seen you since then.    and then everybody want to know whats wrong with the culture. know what im sayin come on man its not a good look.   how does that help anyone in this situation except you  how does it help me to for you to be out there saying im difficult to work with  how does that help me  how does it help you you kick dirt on me that helps you though.  right  make you feel better right   come on now tell the truth.  you was late to the studio like you didnt take it serious.  like it wasnt important to you.  you shovel shit on me like i wasnt 100% professional in working with you.  like i didnt come through to the sessions and wait for 10 hours. i worked with dr period on salute.  everything was dope.  ask dr period how our studio session was how i was professional.   ask flat top how i was professional.  i had to go to rakims crib five times before he did the record. but he did it.   and the days before the day that he wrote it he was just building and i enjoyed it.  why you dont speak on that  speak on the shit thats good for hip hop.   good for you and good for me.   why shovel shit on me for no reason who you working for what agenda you have  how are you helping hip hop by doing that   i do my best on every track.  i go hard on every record.   but you wanna go on tv and radio and what have you and say yeah canibus was this and canibus was that for no reason     14 years ago.  why you dont talk about what we did on c of tranquility.  come on now tell the truth.   every album i do the best that i can do the best that circumstances will admit me at that time.  nobodys perfect but god damn it if i dont give it everything though 100 at all times.  and its as if there is some sort of movement or some sort of deliberate attempt to always when it comes to canibus thats always bringing up old shit something from 14 15 years ago.  always old shit.  never whats currently coming out of canibuss catalogue  what hes doing currently.  and its like a deliberate attempt by the media and everybody who got a motherfuckin microphone in their hand and five minutes to do a little video bite to talk about old shit when my name come up.  cause its always comin up somewhere.  its always comin up.  and to combat that pressure niggas is talkin about old shit instead of what most recently came out. talk about the magick album and what was being said on that album.  talk about c of tranquility and the topics and subject matter touched on that.  talk about something that relevant to now.   dont bring up some old shit that aint got nothing to do with nothing.  come on now. you know what you doing.  ran that baton for so far man.  you aint never supposed to say something foul about the kid man.   how does that help you  the irony about it is that you smilin talkin over it. its bad for me but you smiling though. and when i get a little uptight about it say something about it everybody look at me like im out of bounds and im out of bounds.  you the one thats smiling lying. you already knew  and when i say aight tell the truth.  tell the truth what happened.  tell them niggas you was the one who was late to the studio every day you was late.  come on now tell the motherfuckin truth man tell the truth.  its like you didnt want to do the record
