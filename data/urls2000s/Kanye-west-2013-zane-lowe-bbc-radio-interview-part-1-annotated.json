{"kanye west": ["  zane lowe: grab a seat grab a seat. so you remember this place graduation i was also thinking about some of the other things weve done as well with the bbc like abbey road sprung to mind with the strings.  kanye west: oh yeah. that was good. that suit was like i wouldve worn something different if i could look back right now. i could still do a suit i just wouldnt have done that exact lapel situation.  zl: but talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. that was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective. what are your thoughts when you think back about abbey road where...its just nuts.  kw: i thought it was good. i thought it was what i was supposed to do at that time. if i see something if i see an opportunity im gonna go for it. were all gonna die one day.  zl: yeah thats true.  kw: so live like that. live like you could die tomorrow. go for it. those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far.  zl: and you have man and youre here. six original albums of your own a throne record various records with g.o.o.d. music to talk about. but seriously man yeezus. bravo dude. i mean that is one of the most creative records of any genre ive heard in a very very long time and just in terms of your output your most exciting-sounding record i think.  kw: oh thank you very much. yeah i feel i was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again not having to speak with the textures of the time. cause you know cruel summer is definitely kanye west and theres something weird and kind of off about mercy like when it has the high-pitched impersonates noise that type of sound. it sounds like art still a little bit even though it obviously was a radio smash.  but when i get into the idea the trap drums and things like that certain songs that are blatant radio hits its like im speaking with todays textures. if you look at it 200 years from now its not going to stand out in the way that 808s or yeezus stands out and can completely push or redefine or make people say hey i completely hate that or i completely love that but let me just think differently. because everybody is bound to these -- no pun intended -- theyre bound to sixteen bars or eight bars and the normal radio thing.  i was talking to frank ocean about this and said my mom got arrested for the sit-ins and now were more like the sit-outs. like sit off of radio and say hey radio come to us. we need to find something new because its being controlled in a way and manufactured in a way that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as like something thats very formulaic.  zl: so it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way having the peoples ear having peoples attention for great music to be able to say well if im not challenging them enough im not challenging myself not challenging radio what am i doing  kw: yeah. im not trying to regurgitate myself. i showed people that i understand how to make perfect. dark fantasy could be considered to be perfect. i know how to make perfect. but thats not what im here to do. im here to crack the pavement and make new grounds sonically and society culturally.  zl: youve done that with yeezus. its fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now because normally when i talk to artists about records of this nature its in the lead-up to something. so were all kind of playing a guessing game you know what i mean you could tell me what you think of the record but im trying to find my way around it the audience probably wont have heard it. in this case its been out for a minute so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight too. youve seen what everyone else has had to say about this record both good and bad. but im fascinated to know today how you would describe yeezus as someone who made it. how you would describe that record.  kw: i just think that im a production person im a product guy im a producer. so if im working on a john legend album im gonna try to give john legend the best home for him to stay in. and im gonna try to push pusha t -- no pun intended once again this keeps happening to me -- to make the thing that represents what i like about his music the most. and then for me as kanye west i gotta fuck shit up.  zl: and you did dude seriously. from the minute it starts. i mean seriously. plays opening to on sight. its disgusting.  so youre up in the loft probably at this point and youre kicking around ideas and youre putting things together and this sound comes into your head and youre like this is what im looking for  kw: nah. this is me going to the studio with thomas and guy-manuel whos daft punk. they had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. this is just one session right here. this beat was originally like 14 minutes long and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted and i ended up making that the intro.  zl: you know i got a beef with you over this track. its too short i wanted more out of it. cause its one of the best beats on the record for me and it feels like youre just getting warmed up. was that kind of deliberate to pull back after only a couple of verses and go you know what were going to get on with the album now  kw: nah its just what i felt like it should be.  zl: just a dance thing.  kw: and you know originally blood on the leaves was supposed to be first.  zl: wow.  kw: which psychologically i know would have changed certain yeezus naysayers about the album. it wasnt that time for me. i didnt want to come up there and perform. a lot of times music can be presented as a service position. but i wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music.  you know people go on a vacation and say you got the drugs you got the music you got the wine its in that territory. but i wanted to speak up and say okay so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. its the only place where i actually have a deal so i can only consistently make things in music. so im gonna take music and im gonna try to make it three-dimensional like on star wars and the hologramll pop up out of r2d2. im gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you in a good or bad way. whether its im going into a scream in the middle of the track because thats just the way i feel. but im not here to make easy listening easy programmable music.  zl: no. youre so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. like you talked about the way you use your voice in different ways you dont rely on conventional rhyming flows. your opening line yeezus season approaching you know a monsters awoken. youre laying it out there this isnt my beautiful dark twisted fantasy part 2. im wilding out on this record straight away.  plays interlude from on sight. and then from nowhere as well we just get treated to these wonderful moments where like you say its almost like a collage. like youre sitting here going you know why cant i go into this why not  kw: you can.  zl: and you did.  kw: thats how life is. its like a car crash. you could just be driving and just out of nowhere it happens.  zl: at what point did that very deliberate feel to the record whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way at what point did that start to take shape because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole the way it flips between one and the other. was that in your head early on or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record  kw: well i didnt reduce it. rick rubin reduced it. hes not a producer hes a reducer. laughs.  zl: but was it always part of the process for you to say why dont i take elements of this and this and just claps hands together bolt it together  kw: yeah. its just the way i was consuming information in my life at the time. negative information to positive information from the internet just going to the louvre going to furniture exhibits and understanding that trying to open up and do interviews like this learning more about architecture. taking one thousand meetings attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. getting no headway whatsoever. it was just that level of frustration. this is what frustration fucking sounds like.  this is what frustration sounds like. for me as kanye west i would not be kanye west if it wasnt for michael jackson. i was with quincy jones a couple days ago at john legends wedding. quincy was telling me it wasnt just mike but these guys broke down the barriers. of course you know michael jackson he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. this is michael jackson. michael jacksons not even black hes michael jackson -- you know what i mean hes so crazy how can he even be classified as this black artist  so for me in my life and creativity its been challenging and everything. but i was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights what michael jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. there would be no kanye west if it wasnt for michael jackson - that allowed him to be that right  now lets take people who have issues with me as kanye west. they classify my motivational speeches as rants - like why is he saying that why is he doing that well ive reached a point in my life where my truman show boat has hit the painting. and ive got to a point that michael jackson did not break down. i have reached the glass ceiling - as a creative person as a celebrity.  when i say that it means i want to do product. i am a product person. not just clothing but water bottle design architecture everything that you could think about. and ive been at it for 10 years and i look around and i say hey wait a second - theres no one around here in this space that looks like me. and if they are theyre quiet as fuck  so that means - wait a second - now were seriously in a civil rights movement. like people used to joke about - remember our south park photo - remember how funny that was do you think there would be a givenchy in the hood if it wasnt for that south park photo. but no one thinks about that - no one thinks about the names i got called for wearing tight jeans.  zl: you reference that in the record you talk about that. no ones liked him since hes been wearing tight jeans. everybody knows you brought back real rap. i mean you reference that in the record.  kw: im saying yall had all that but i brought real rap back. im going to do dope things. and i wanna take this opportunity to speak to something because i go to hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things thatre coming out. and every time my name goes up theres a series of people who write just negative comments - they wanna joke around and say why is he still trying why is he doing this they like diss me as a person for trying. now mind you ive brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity.  and now what they dont realize when i say hey this is pusha t this is what it is i have to remind pusha t that hes pusha t. because the radio if theyre not playing a song of his that has an r&b hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs its like we forget about that clipse album that meant everything.  and the reason why i relate it to design and what we do in design is saying thats the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design - we looked at clipse as the gods and this is our soundtrack to creativity. and its not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity. no knock to trap cause i did cant tell me nothing - i like it. but its been commercialized to the point where - and im not mentioning no names - but people used to use the term r&b nigga but then it was rappers. but then rappers didnt wanna be no r&b nigga. now the rappers is the new r&b niggas the rappers the new radio like wheres the culture at where is the culture at  so then i scream - and im sitting in the middle of it - whether im at a dinner with anna wintour or im at a listening session with pusha or me and virgil are in rome giving designs to fendi over and over and gettin our designs knocked down. brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to fendi and they said no. how many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant meaning when i see hedi slimane and its all like ok this is my take on the world - yeah he got some nice $5000 jeans in there some nice ones here and there some good shit here and there.  but we culture. rap the new rock n roll we culture rap is the new rock n roll we the rock stars  zl: its been like that now for a minute.  kw: its been like that for a minute hedi slimane its been like that for a minute. we the real rock stars and im the biggest of all of em. im the number one rock star on the planet.  click here for part 2  "]}
