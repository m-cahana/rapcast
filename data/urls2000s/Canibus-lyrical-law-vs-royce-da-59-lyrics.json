{"canibus": ["", "   yo i dont need no 2pac budget to get 2pac rugged. i get at you with nothing fuck it. see the difference between me and you is i know what im up against and imma still go in. i know yall got money. i know yall got sugar daddies in high places  tell me something nigga. do you know who mcgregor mathers is you dont know mcgregor mathers is elvis grandfather i only met proof one time in 2000 on elvis tour bus in syracuse new york. the nigga stepped to his business with me in defense of elvis cause he loved elvis. we almost came to blows on that bus over how much this nigga loved elvis. and all i did was tell elvis the truth about how i wasnt comfortable with what he said with that cancerous coulda respond back with a battle rap you wrote for canibus shit. i done said it a million times that i felt it was an ambiguous line to say about somebody you claim you idolized especially with all that shit i was dealing with. thats why when clef told me elvis was ghostwriting for l i didnt even understand why the fuck elvis came to my video set for i honor u talking bout i just want to do something with you dog. everybody and their momma in this music industry turned their back on me a&rs djs artists fans everybody. twelve albums later niggas want to act like they dont know how much i love hip-hop and what i stand for in hip-hop and how i dont lay down for knowing justice is against the culture. the way i feel about this shit it goes all the way back to betrayal because at the end of the day niggas like you only give a fuck about yourself and devil rewards you for selling out your own niggas real talk  let me ask you something royce. why did the nigga that used to run with proof real tough get on the phone and tell me thank you for holding them down cause deshauns family was starving this was before i wrote my fucking verse for air strike. he told me to throw rosenberg under the bus. he told me wasnt nobody over there eating none of the holtons or d12 none of them. i couldnt even believe it. i didnt even write my verse for air strike and this niggas telling me thank you. til this day the only way i can rationalize it is to think with my heart and know that proof was talking to me through this nigga telling me thank you cause after air strike came out elvis and rosenberg doubled back to feed holtons family. listen i respect d12 but how can i tell them that why would they listen to me theyre not gon bite the hand that feed them so i made it easy for niggas. i lit the wick and they cut the fuse. i gave them the chance to tell the whole world the same shit proof told me through his man. i gave them the chance to tell the world about how they really feel about elvis pushing them to the side to sign voltron 5. you will have to be blind deaf and numb not to see how them niggas must feel right now. i guarantee you after i said that line ya niggas came together like a team cause yall had a common enemy me. recognize whats real nigga. stop talking about you dont want nobody dividing you when you aint doing nothing for niggas any goddamn way. its fucked up cause crook is a real nigga and ortiz is cool too but youre the one thats trying to divide niggas. how youre gon do a hrsmn record without me on it motherfucker  you so gangster the fuck youre doing on twitter talking to some fake ass account anyway you dont think i know whats going on you think i dont know what the fuck is going on you think i dont know elvis got the whole hip-hop industry on payroll including you how easy is it to read between those lines i aint seen near one site confirm what the real canibus twitter is. they just keep repeating the fake twitter account to fuck me around instead of trying to rectify the problem so when you do the hrsmn record without me on the shit everybody gon think i did it to myself. wow genius huh act like you know nigga. canibus dont need no twitter to tell you what the fuck he feeling nigga. i mastered my pen and i mastered these rhymes. go make some fucking music and stop typing into a freaking machine  i won the whole hip hop franchise in 98 when i started my album up with a dial-up modem. i was the first mc with a website. all of a sudden nobody in the first-world country could function without technology but instead of niggas using this shit to be more real they used the smoke and mirrors to make us antagonize each other with the exponential ability to brainwash the entire hip-hop generation to turn their backs on the champions of the culture to isolate and alienate the artists who the media has purposefully blackballed like yours truly  you know what im done man. fuck you royce. you dont give a fuck about hip-hop man. how you gon call yourself a lyricist and disrespect me keep doing what your master tell you to do cause theres always a company thats gon buy you that number one spot for selling that watered-down bullshit until they switch you out. and check this out all that weapon talk yada yada tell them super security niggas to teach you how to disassemble clean and reassemble your shit if youre trying to get funky like that nigga  "]}
