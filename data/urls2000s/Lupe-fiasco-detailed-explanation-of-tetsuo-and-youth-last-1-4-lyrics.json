{"lupe fiasco": ["  detailed explanation of tetsuo & youth winter to spring \tafter listening to lupes new album tetsuo & youth multiple times i specifically want to begin this discussion by getting into the albums last portion which went from the season winter to spring. note that there is a lot of religious content that was referenced in this time period i will get into all that later \tthe season started with chopper and a lot of people are wondering why a song like chopper is on the album. well you cant just go into a song like deliver without giving an example of why the pizza man wont come to the ghetto. that is why chopper is there a hood ass trap song with features from rappers that purposefully spit their verses from the perspective of the killers drug dealers and gangstaz that live in the trap \tmoving onto deliver like i said this song shows the results of what went down in chopper and the reasons behind not delivering pizza to the hood. if we look at the main line from the hook pizza man dont come here no more it contains a triple entendre: firstly the forefront meaning is that the pizza cant be delivered to such dangerous locations; secondly the peace-of man doesnt come there no more this is similar to the first meaning because there is violence preventing the pizza man from delivering the pizza this all goes back to chopper and how the absence of peace stirs up the controversy; thirdly the piece-of man doesnt come there no more. literally this one ties into the next song madonna and other mothers of the hood because the piece-of man not being there referring to the father figures that are absent while their child grows up. with no father figure the child will live his life without an example to follow or know what is right from wrong so chances are hell be sucked into the hood activities such as drug dealing and gang affiliations which will eventually lead to the concern of his mother for her childs well being. with all the information thus far i think its time to start pointing out some religious references. firstly madonna in other words means virgin mary the mother of jesus who never had a blood related father. similarly to how mary feared jesuss prosecution the last thing that the mothers of the hood want are to see their sons die before their very eyes but at the end of the song referencing to the movie boyz in da hood the child lied dead in his moms house just like ricky in the movie much like how mary was in attendance at jesuss crucifixion \tthe next song the adoration of the magi contains a significant amount of video game references that foreshadow two things: the game a character returning from lupes second album the cool and the next song which he appears in t.r.o.n. a video game that came out in lupes birth year. this song is speaking about a magi or a king from old times. in this song the magi is played by the game. for those who dont know his background he can be described as someone that controls everything in the evilest of ways and this song is almost a continuation of the song he appeared in from the cool put you on game. here are lyrics from that song that show the reference to this song im sure somebodyll find you tied up in this bag behind the hospital little baby crack addicts had then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper. this song adoration of the magi continues the baby theme in the chorus as it uses other artists albums with babies on the covers carter 3 nwts illmatic etc. to symbolize that they they are too young to be on a rap cover but that is why the game adores them so much and is interested in the youth. that is why he made a reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in. towards the last line of this song it becomes clear that the baby grew up to be a stripper just like the game suggested and she is even having her own child too but doesnt know it this is why she is wanted by the game or adored by the magi. religiously speaking the adoration of the magi story has to do with the 3 western kings that lived centuries ago. they followed a star and found the whereabouts of jesus where they presented him with gifts. this event happened on jan. 6 which marks the same day lupe released this song. now that we have went over the 3 singles for this album madonna deliver adoration of the magi its about the time we can discuss a vital point that lupe tweeted he said what if i told you that madonna delivered the adoration of the magi heres were things get even crazier. from a religious perspective madonna virgin mary delivered the adoration of the magi jesus. if we look at it from the ghettos perspective he is saying madonna and other mothers of the hood delivered the adoration of the game strippers gangstaz drug dealers killers. \tleading into the next song they.resurrect.over.new. will probably have the listener wondering why there are so many video game references well the answer is simple. if this album is about the youth which lupe has stated numerous times in many interviews if people were wondering. thats where we get the title of the album with a little flair with tetsuo in front of it. then what other way would be better to portray the game in front of the youths eyes to a grown man the game is the drug game strip clubs war zones etc. but to a baby the game is just simply a video game to them. in this song lupe said things like we should be closer and that is a direct message to the ghetto because his people are killing each other in there. ab-soul continues the game theme by saying trapped in a game where the trap is the game yeah. and the only way to get passed the game is to proceed to the next level which is telling the youth to not fall into the hands of the game and end up as the killers that make up chi-raq the strippers that make up the strip clubs or the drug dealers that make up the drug game. rather the point of proceeding to the next level is to break away from the shackles or like ab-souls last line unloose the noose. that is the only way to crush the hood stereotypes. \t\t that is about it for the album but there is still the concept of the seasons that go on throughout the album that seem really random. lupe described them as palette cleaners to give soothing breaks throughout the album but it is even more. notice how in winter there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly eerie feeling from the sounds playing that was the mood set for chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during winter this is why lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so that kids can play on the streets again. the album also halts at spring and there is nothing between that and summer in the album it is almost like a sign that it is up for the youth to decide what goes on in that season. lupe basically just said this is the way. now its up them. that is about all i can think about in these last 5-7 tracks. if you read this far i hope you have a better understanding of this seasons meaning and message  p.s. this is only a fourth of the album and lupes favorite season on the album is fall to winter. i dare someone to decode that season now :  "]}
