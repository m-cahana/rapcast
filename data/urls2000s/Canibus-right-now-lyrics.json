{"canibus": ["  canibus this is a new season with new rhymes for the same reason the public needs it but without faith they wont believe it we cursed since birth imprisoned by these earth demons my verse is written in secret then released in pieces the sting of rejection the sour sensation of perfection its connected to our spiritual ascension start with yourself you are your only contender the game of life has no winners therefore we surrender  chorus: canibus write now write your thoughts down now recite them out loud now the bright light bleeds down through the dark clouds now right now brothers now right now sisters now right now people now right now rippers  canibus the rhyme is my religion the rhythm is alive listen and bear witness try to share my vision my vision of my soul inside sol free the globe inside a globe with two poles ouroboros in my poems bestowed by a poet what do you know and when did you know it obey the law with its fundamentally flawed components omit this admit this a myth til i spit you forget how ill i get the rippers bout to rip right now right now  "]}
