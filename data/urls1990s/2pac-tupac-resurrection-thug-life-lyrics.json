{"az ": ["  when im saying thug i mean not criminals; someone who beats you up and that i mean the underdog the person that nothing succeeds; hes a thug because he overcome all obstacles it doesnt have anything to do with the dictionaries version of thug for me thug is my pride not being someone who goes against the law not being someone to take but being someone who has nothing and that he dont have nothing and theres no home for him to go to my head is up high my chest is out i walk tall i talk loud  im being strong  i dont understand why america doesnt understand thug life. america is thug life. what makes me saying i dont give a fuck different than patrick henry saying give me liberty or give me death what makes my freedom less worth fighting for than bosnians or whoever they want to fight for this year  they should give money to the ghetto  i mean i think even gangs can be positive. it just has to be organized it has to steer away from being self-destructive to being self-productive i organized the ogs on the east and west coasts in penitentiaries to come up with codes of ethics for criminals its called the code of thug life its a code putting order to the violence on the streets in watts compton chicago wherever people all over the country say we go by this code were against attacks on people not involved with the street gang the drug trade or the illegal business at all.  all that kidnapping and shooting drive-bys we against that. thug life aint just a bunch of niggas going crazy we wanna patrol our streets. so all we saying is if every motherfucker out here right now gave up one dollar to this thug life fund the money dont go to me it go to somebody from yall neighborhood and we do this shit every month. ill bring new rappers ill bring snoop whoever yall want ill go snatch them niggas. for that shit to happen we cant have violence and everybody gotta be down for that shit  "]}
