{"az ": ["  when your heart turns cold it causes your soul 2 freeze spreads throughout your spirit like a ruthless feeling disease the walls that once were down now stand firm and tall safe from hate/love pain/joy until u feel nothing at all when ure heart turns cold a babys cry means nothing a dead corpse is trivial mothers neglecting children is daily lonliness becomes your routine friend death seems like tranquility sleeping is never pleasant if you even sleep at all u forget ideals and turn off the reason 2 make sure the product is sold you dont understand how i behave just wait till your heart turns cold  "]}
