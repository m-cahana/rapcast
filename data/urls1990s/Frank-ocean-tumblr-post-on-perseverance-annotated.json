{"o.c.": ["  no matter how dim it gets wherever i am  i never quit working. i work in the dark cause work is light. i tell my work all my problems because it never gives answers i have already. it never edits without me. doesnt call me names. i give my work away because it doesnt cost me much. in fact im indebted. i work hard since life is hard. death is a soft place it can wait. but work aint love. and love aint work. for sure.
