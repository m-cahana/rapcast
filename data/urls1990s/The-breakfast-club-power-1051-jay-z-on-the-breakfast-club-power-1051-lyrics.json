{"jay-z": ["  dj envy: we got a special guest in the building this morning  charlamagne tha god: nah nah nah you say special guest all the time we got something different. special legendary iconic you

on pecas back  all laughing  envy: well welcome  jay: thank you. this is very hard to navigate  envy: no matter what happens in here just dont get charlamagne fired. it was rumours that you got charlamagne fired one time just dont get him fired  jay: oh gosh  ctg: listen my last name is pinkett-smith winfrey knowles-carter okay we cool over here  envy: alright just making sure  ctg: i wanted to get you a throne too but they werent sure if you were coming. i was like we cant have jay sitting in this chair but they said yo he is from marcy he sat on stoops back then  jay: yeah i can take it back for.. how long we here a couple hours  ay: i guess well see  envy: well congratulations on the album the album is in stores right now  ay: yes and you were on twitter last night that was incredible a lot of people didnt believe that was you  jay: i actually had fun. that was amazing i had a great time. that is addictive i cant be on twitter its like weed. like i like it but too much of thats not good for me  ay: theres no way you could see everybodys questions either so people were like oh you didnt answer my question  jay: yeah well i mean its impossible  ay: do you know who the people are like some of the people you were answering i was like oh i know who that person is or were you just really..  jay: nah nah no i didnt know anyone. i knew one person i knew gee spin  ay: oh you know gee spin  all laughing  ctg: so you actually do know gee spin we were taking bets on that too  envy: we didnt think you knew gee spin too  ctg: we were taking bets on that one. does gee really know jay  jay: yeah i know gee spin thats one of my cowboys thats the only person i knew i didnt know anybody else  ctg: now im a cowboy fanatic too they always give me flack cause im from south carolina so i shouldnt root for the cowboys. how do you do it being from new york when you got the giants and the jets how can you be a cowboys fan in this city  jay: i grew up my pop its really my pop fault you know  ctg: he grew up here  jay: he grew up here yeah. that era those guys who wanted that whole cowboy lifestyle all those guys was on coke you know  laughing  ctg: my pops was definitely on coke  jay: i got the whole thing penned i can give you the whole profile he have the afro  ctg: he had the afro  ay: but i bet your dad didnt tase somebody at the cowboys jets game like charlamagnes dad did  ctg: that was my father  envy: hes a real  jay: tased  ay: he tased somebody at the game  ctg: remember last year at the first game cowboys jets at met life stadium  jay: like in this era  ctg: yes  cause he didnt know hes from south carolina that tasers are illegal ay: last year. he got arrested  jay: nah. yeah  ctg: he got in to a fight with some jets fans hes a cowboys guy  jay: thats.. yeah. i definitely wouldnt have put that on the profile but uh that type of fan uh you know its my pops team so i couldnt i had to watch it growing up  envy: its going to be tough this year i dont know if you can make the play offs this year  jay: alright man.. envy: them giants looking good im just saying them giants looking good. we just signed victor cruz for another six years  ctg: if the jets are winning next season hes a jets fan if the giants start winning he roots for the giants. hes confused  jay: its too early in the morning for that bro  ay: now i was shocked at one thing on twitter where you said that magna carta holy grail was fighting for 4th place as far as best albums. cause i think every time you put out an album ok this is my best album to date. and that was very honest of you to say that but do you really believe that only 4th place  jay: i mean only fourth place fighting to that top 3 you gotta fight reasonable doubt blueprint and the black album. thats just i mean thats just hard  ay: is that the order you put it in in that order reasonable doubt first  jay: reasonable doubt well yeah thats the first album i made because thats the joint i took my whole life to make. reasonable doubt then blueprint then the black album. sometimes i switch the blueprint and the black album dont tell anybody  ctg: is it hard though cause youre competing against yourself. youre competing against classics. to me you cant compare holy grail to reasonable doubt to the blueprint cause they were different times in your life  jay: true. thats part of the reason i put it fourth its very difficult to re-create those times. those times were like.. obviously you cant bring those times back. but just for it to be so high says what i think about it. whilst its new anyway i might not think that way in 2 weeks  envy: whats the inspiration cause i know you used to say big used to inspire you to spit and nas do you get inspired by artists now  jay: the era i grew up in was like biggie nas 2pac you know its very difficult to compare to those guys you know it just is. im inspired by my previous work. i have to measure myself against that  envy: i guess do you ever hear a record now like im going in the lab or does it just seem like its abc-123. cause a lot of the music to me it doesnt i know it makes you sound like an old head but it just dont sound the same it just dont feel the same  jay: nah theres good music you just gotta mine for it you know i mean before i felt there was an abundance of it. but thats what happens when anything becomes successful. like people were rapping because they love to rap. then it became this huge business this multi-billion dollar business so people that didnt even care to rap was like imma figure out how to get some money in this so you had people who could rap a little bit and saw it as a hustle and you had guys ceos rapping no disrespect to anyone just to be clear you had people rapping like you should rap like big told puff you should rap. puff wasnt a rapper. but you know he had he was puff you know what im saying he sold 7 million records maybe more by now with the catalogue. he sold 7 million records with *no way out*. he never rapped before so when people see that they emulate that. so now you got all kind of ceos rapping and now you have . im a ceo rapping.. so umm now its like you know its flooded with guys who arent rappers so you just gotta mine it. and youll find good music still its just more difficult to find  ctg: so puff fed the game up is what youre saying for lyricists  jay: nah..  all laughing  jay: is that all you got out of that  ay: i would assume youre inspired by the artists that you sign also or else why would sign them if you didnt find them to be an inspiration to you  jay: ok. that couldve been my answer  ay: now for instance j. cole you know obviously  jay: yes very dope  ay: jay electronica  jay: very dope too  ay: he said hes up next too  ctg: were waiting. thats like detox  jay: lets hope not  all laughing  ctg: what artist that you signed are you most proud of cause youre responsible for a lot of careers out here  jay: youd have to say kanye west. hes the most successful at this stage of his career. and his growth and the progress that hes made its like.. its unbelievable. when he first came in he wasnt the artist that he is today. but he always aspired to be you know. from that moment from the moment he walked through the door when he was just a producer not just a producer when he was the producer he had it in his eyes he was saying stuff like i am the saviour of chicago. i was like what you even talking about you aint even have a single. but you know he proved to be prophetic in that way  ctg: now age old hood question i always said that you put too much pressure on bleek. cause early in his career you said he was gonna be the new improved jay z. now he was good but everybody was waiting for him to be that. do you feel like you kind of mightve you know  jay: yeah hes just a little brother its the situation you know little brother syndrome. he had it more so than anybody cause he really grew up with me. he grew up on the third floor in the same projects from me so he had my shadow on him you know the whole time. so whether i said those things or not it was just there. me saying those things actually was trying to deflect it you know trying to deflect some of it away from him. i wasnt trying to put more on him it was just.. elephant in the room you walk in the room be like everybodys thinking yo thats the thats the next guy. its natural  ctg: i never saw you do that with any of your other artists afterwards i wondered if that if that was something you said you know what im not going to do that  jay: yeah he again he was just one of a kind. like he really was from there. like val his mother i used to go in there and be like val open the door and drag him out the house. you know so he was a unique guy  ay: and hes always been very loyal to you like even to this day  jay: yeah yeah. bleek is an amazing soul hes an incredible person  ctg: i always say  jay: you know how much pressure people put on him  all: absolutely  envy: and bleek is  jay: you should do this you should have that you should have $100 million you know that type of its crazy unrealistic things  envy: bleek gets busy in the streets too hell come see you if you say the wrong thing. hell definitely come see you. not of recent but  jay: yeah dont pump bleek up  envy: yeah hell definitely come see you  all laughing  jay: dont do that  envy: now also you spoke of kanye west. what do you think of yes last album yeezus  jay: i liked it  ctg: nah come on hov.. out of ten record i give him four  jay: thats a good thats like 40% of a rating thats pretty good  ctg: hes got an amazing catalogue though. he should never put out anything that people even consider a four  jay: jesus.. yeezus  all laughing  ay: some people love that album you know its very experimental  jay: its polarising thats what great art is. its polarising some people love it. it force you to have an opinion you know at least youre not like wishy washy about it it force you to have an opinion which is good i think its needed. because what tends to happen is someone has to experiment and do it first and then artists will sit back and watch it and be like ok i like this i dont like that i like this part and theyll perfect the methods and you know it all pushes the genre forward. which is good and thats what he does hes like the lightning rod for the culture. no hes actually like the cowboy you know he runs over the hill and like the indians hit him with the arrows and he comes back hes like yo theres a lot of them over there and then we go over there and conquer  all laughing  ctg: whats your reaction whenever you hear him like denounce corporations being that you are such a corporate dude yourself  jay: as an individual i respect that. you know its what he chooses to do. you know me me myself i can operate in that venue i can walk that line between you know putting out great art and getting paid for my art. im not one of those excuse my language i aint one of those niggas they can talk to like you an artist you shouldnt have money. like thats the gas they hit you with that they make you yeah i dont want any money i want to be a pure artist and i dont want to have uh you know its the music business. if thats the case then you should any artist not kanye west you should they should just record in their basement and never enter the music business. you know i just happen to be really good at the music business  ay: do you pay attention to reviews on the album does that affect you do you read it like do you want to see what they said on usa today  jay: yeah i think reviews i think reviews have lost a lot of their importance now because of the internet. like everyone is experiencing things at the same time. like you can write a review like uh the guy from usa today tomorrow. you both can write the review at the same time. before you used to give albums out like thats what happened thats why the critic became important in the music space because they got the music first they would get the music 2 months early because you know the magazine had a long lead time. they get it they sit with it they review it they send it out a month ahead of time. you reading it you looking like oh this albums gonna be dope you dont have the music. so youre reading reviews for a month right now the music comes out like this. people are writing the review in a day. first of all you cant listen to an album and rate it in a day. its just impossible  ctg: like magna carta a classic 10 minutes after it comes out  jay: yeah its impossible to even get what every  ay: you have to sit with it to live with it  jay: the nuances the all the instrumentation all the words what is being said in the music what is it about its impossible to do that in 24 hours. when i see that im like oh so this is all just bullshit. ok so i cant put any weight in it. its good you reviewed the album its great you like it fantastic you dont like it thats good too. but it doesnt mean anything because you know  ay: we can all stream it and listen to it and form our own opinion  jay: thats right. you can have a better review than the guy from the ny times. like i read 2 reviews i read the guy from the ny times and i read the kid from allhiphop. they both had interesting points of views. the guy from allhiphop was talking about purgatory which i feel like sometimes you know its like when you walk that line its like you cant do too much for this side and you do too much for this side its a weird thing im in a weird space which you know i enjoy. i felt like his review was just as great as the ny times writers review and this is supposed to the the ny times you know what im saying same thing to me  ay: yeah  ctg: do you feel like people consume music too fast cause you create these amazing moments but then the moment is fleeting. soon as you put the album out its like people are on it for a few days then ok j cole came out wale comes out the next week. wales out now hovs out you know what i mean  jay: yeah yeah. its just yeah. again the time that we in. we have to figure out i mean its up to the individual to figure out how to slow it down because you know its just going faster and faster you know everything is moving quicker and quicker. you know information is going quicker you know again like you said you know these great things are fleeting theyre going faster and faster and its up to the individual to slow it down and be like ok im living with this album this is what i choose to ride to. this is going to be the soundtrack to my life for these next couple of months. you know what im saying thats an individual thing im not going to let anybody speed up my process. i dont care whats happening out there thats the great thing about you know having the ultimate confidence in yourself it doesnt matter whats happening i dont care whats happening i dont care what youre on or this persons on. this is what i like you know. my life is tailor made for me  envy: you ever got to watch your lyrics you know cause things you say people take literally. i remember watching the press conference at the white house and theyre quoting jay z lyrics about something that you say you ever be like man i shouldnt have said that  jay: nah. its im an artist i have the creative licence to say whatever i feel at that moment. you know ill find things funny like the obama thing obama said the irony in that the fact that people really believed that and really was like you lied  all laughing  jay you believed that  all laughing  ctg: you do say hashtag facts only  all laughing  jay: yeah but irony irony is you know you gotta have some irony in music that was like you know..  ctg: question as a fan is it ever awkward when youre in a room with nas cause that ether/takeover beef with yall wasnt light  envy: it was disrepectful  jay: it was a time in it was a moment in time which was a great moment for hip hop. but for us you know we really have a good relationship. we laugh we dont even that thing is so far past and i understand why you know even today that thing is i guess is 11 years old maybe longer and like people still fascinated with it but its so far removed its so far in the background as that nah were not awkward around each other at all  ay: the great thing about it is that it didnt destroy either of your careers  ctg: it helped nas  ay: yeah it did help him at that time. but for both of you its not like ok now this guy just destroyed me cause that happens sometimes with beef but you guys both were still successful after that you even more so  envy: you hurt a lot of careers you know  jay: rap is competitive. you know its a competitive sport. each time i went out i put my career on the line as well you know like that. it couldve happened to me  envy: like prodigy  jay: everybody wanted it to happen like they did there was a time like everybody was like please please let this guy go away. so uh you know thats just the nautre of rap. its competitive. every time you go out there youre putting your career on the line  ctg: would you ever do a king of new york album with nas like you did with watch the throne  jay: um.. yeah.. nah.. not at this point. you know like any other collaboration album would have to be with kanye cause you know theres chemistry there. we know how were working. i dont really have the time to figure out both situations and figure out how a person works. thats hard to do especially if youre going to make something great you know. the hardest thing ever was going through those r. kelly albums you know he its just you never know how the situation is going to turn out. theres an x factor that you cant even calculate in your mind that can happen at any moment and youll be like in the hotel ready to make an announcement its like what what just happpened  ctg: ty-ty get the pepper spray  all laughing  envy: we had jadakiss up here and ugh we were talking about throw offs and jadakiss was like you are the biggest throw off like when it comes to trying to get you on the phone  ctg: curve  ay: spin no he said spin youre the master spinner  envy: master spinner  ay: you spin people  envy: he said when it comes to getting hov on the phone hov will call you like the day after and be like i just got back from in the country i just got your text you still need me  jay: sounds like me sounds like real talk to me  all laughing  ay: at least you do answer his calls though you know. thats important  jay: yeah yeah yeah yeah. jadakiss can get me on the phone any time  ay: was it nerve wracking doing this whole new deal with samsung that had never been done before and then were like some glitches people were saying and trying to get the app right and the album cause its the first time its been done  jay: yeah and that again in that instance i was the cowboy running over the hill. you know any time you try to do something different and you should always try to push forward in whatever youre doing theres going to be problems cause its never been done before. again you cant anticipate all the things that are going to happen. the thing that happened with samsung was a real thing. it was 20 million hits to the app im not saying 20 million people hit the app but you know a million people we went over a million say a million and 3 or whatever was trying right and you couldnt get through you know you hit it 20 times and thats 20 million hits it was 20 million hits for the app and it broke. no-ones expecting theres no way in the world for you to calculate 20 million hits. its not even a number that you can fathom. its 20 times the amount we thought was gonna happen. so you cant even prepare servers for that its very difficult  ay: in a way its a great problem to have  jay: its not a great problem cause you want the fan to get that experience the people that waited and downloaded you want them to have that experience right away. thats the only thing that was a little disheartening to me cause man imagine that i cant even imagine waiting for rakims album at 12 o clock and i couldnt get it i downloaded  ay: i downloaded the app i got the samsung phone  jay: i did everything right. i downloaded my app i read it i said it i watched the clock countdown and at 12 o clock i couldnt get it. for me thats not cool you know thats a loss and that has to get better. but again someone else is gonna figure out the next person now know you know how to go on to it better. which is cool and thats my job i took the hit for that  ctg: i saw you tweet ab-soul yesterday to say that you was a fan of the whole movement i guess the whole black hippy movement with kendrick lamar who keeps you in tune with that stuff cause people think you dont live on this planet so you dont know whats going on  jay: yeah like an alien or something. i like music i really like music and when people make good music i will find it. i dont listen to everything i dont really care to listen to everything. i actually dont want to listen to anything. so if it makes it to me that means youre doing something right  ctg: you hear a lot of new york artists complain about the state of new york hip hop. you are a new york artist over the years have you looked at new york and been like whats going on with our city musically  jay: yeah but thats just a thing you know its cool its a regional thing like. thats the way music moves. you know. out west down south you know whatever thats the way it move. the whole thing is complaining does nothing. make music make some great music and thats the end of it. like i dont even know what to say. you know  ctg: im too busy winning over here  jay: no i just dont care about it. its almost like a losers mentality. its like everyones so spoiled its like you know you wont let me shine. i even heard someone say yo why wont jay let kanye. im like let kanye kanye is kanye hes gonna do what he does thats a losers mentality. when we were i sound like one of those gravel when we were coming up i mean it was my albums came out with outkast lauryn q-tip all of them in one week you know everybody did good. you know look at the chart now. its wale number 1 this is a shameless plug. roc nation managed artist. j. cole which will probably go to number 1 next week again no for the first time ever hell go to number 1 roc nation artist then there is kanye. you gotta be able to compete. steel sharpen steel. you gotta get out there you gotta earn your spot. its not given. its such a spoilt brat losers mentality that its annoying  ctg: is there anybody new from new york that youre feeling  jay: yeah they making noise they havent reached the level yet to really be like  ay: shout them out  jay: yeah  all laughing  jay: they on they  ctg: for real though  jay: i mean. but you know its good but again its not really about its not a regional thing. unless theres like 5 of them thats the only way you can make it live. thats the only way you can make hip hop live in your region when you have 4 or 5 people doing it at one time. when you have 1 person flourishing it is what it is  envy: has fatherhood changed you at all as far as lyrics  jay: i mean absolutely  envy: how is jay as a dad  jay: i hope im great. but im learning. its a new thing for me. and i guess changed me in a way that i mean just knowing whats important knowing the things that are important. you know. but i had a pretty good sense of that but it just reaffirmed all the things i believed i knew  envy: now how are you with and the reason im asking is cause im going through it now how are you with like every 2 hours the baby getting up and changing pampers  jay: nah i got an army man  envy: you aint do that man  jay: i mean of course but come on man. its hard man. difficult  ay: can i ask you a question the first thing i thought when i heard about roc nation sports  jay: im hear to be asked questions. i didnt want to get you on your thing  ay: dont get started. thats all.. did you have to give up your seats at the barclays centre  jay: no  ctg: i told you that that part in open letter  jay: no  ay: thats true  jay: no no course not. i still own the building  ay: no cause i used to be able to go to the nets games and sit in your seats because you never used to go to those in jersey  jay: yeah nah you good dont even worry about it. this is a selfish question  ctg: this is selfish you just wanna make sure  ay: this is  all laughing  jay: that question is loaded dont worry you good. i will invite you to four games a year  ay: ok i just wanted to make sure  ctg: can we clear up another power 105 bet. these two were arguing about who knew jay the longest. ay and dj envy  jay: nah i definitely knew envy before angie  envy: i told her i knew you before mary j blige was on the hook to cant knock the hustle when it was that wax  jay: yeah yeah yeah  ay: no no. i think i knew you longer  ctg: she thinks she used to help yall bag up in that apartment in brooklyn with ty-ty and b-high  all laughing  ay: i think i might have known you longer than envy though. oh man i shouldve brought that tape in cause when i met you you were giving out tapes of dead president single  jay: yeah that was too late by then. i recorded i had to record the album first  ay: that was a single though it wasnt a whole album  jay: no but im saying i had to record it hes the first why dont you just give him that  ay: alright alright  jay: you were shortly thereafter  ay: thats when he was dj shrimp  envy: i was definitely dj shrimp  jay: you never knew before me  ctg: another hood question. do you ever feel sorry for damon dash. whenever you hear about his financial problems or things like that  jay: nah. dame is a hustler dame will figure it out. dame is very smart guy. you know. so hell figure it out  ay: he was definitely playing your album on instagram bittersweet  ctg: yeah did you see that video  jay: nah i didnt see  ctg: it was in the barer shop. he bumping his head crazy to it. he said he liked it. he said he felt like he was a part of that he says he feels like you were telling the truth  jay: i feel like what people gotta understand nothing is gonna change the way i feel about dame. no time or space no separation or anything. you know i got love for dame the same way as i did before. i dont know if we can be around each other in that way because times have changed. you know he may be a totally different person i know im a different person. but nothing can erase that era and the things that we you know those times those memories those fights that we have you know to get rocafella where it was. it just it what it is. nothings gonna change that. therell be some minor things you know in the middle that get in the way but those things go away but those relationships remain those memories remain. we did something great we built something that is gonna be here forever that is gonna be talked about forever so you know there will always be you know umm love there  envy: what was your worst signing at rocafella the worst person that just didnt fit at rocafella  ctg: amil  ay: no  jay: nah nah i wouldnt say amil amil album you should listen to it  ctg: i did  jay: its good  ctg: nah  ay: you had a reggaeton era as well  jay: yeah. yeah  ctg: was you really responsible for that or was that more dame  jay: im not gonna put anyone under that. im gonna take that one on my back  all laughing  ctg: that didnt seem like hov  jay: im gonna take that one for the team  ctg: those dirty signing didnt seem like..  jay: imma take all that for the team. what was the worst signing  ctg: you was talking about how amil was your worst signing  jay: nah i didnt say that  envy: you know somebody that didnt fit all laughing  jay: i.. let me think about that  envy: what was the artist that you passed upon that you couldve had that you didnt sign  jay: passed on i dunno  envy: was there anyone you passed on  jay: i dont know if we passed on anybody that we couldve that was great. umm. because we signed everybody  envy: at the end yall were signing everybody  ctg: tax write offs  jay: oh my god. thats not even like a real thing. but. its funny  ctg: when you look at the game and you look at where youre at right now and you look at your peers you came up with in the 90s do you say to yourself i knew they were gonna be here and those guys were gonna be there and im asking that cause i want to know what you think of the game now and who is gonna be here in ten years from now  jay: uh yeah. i absolutely because i wanted to be here. and i saw a lot of people let opportunities go. and i was like oh hes not gonna be around why arent you doing this if i had that id be doing this i think about it in those terms. i think about it not outside of what we do i think about it in strategic moves when you have it and you about to have it and you know what happens you know. i remember one time walking in the studio and uh it was like a small gap and uh bleek beans everybody was in there and i was like man im telling you yall got a chance right now flood it put out a lot of music. because 50 cent is coming and you know four months later in da club hit and it was over and everybody gotta sit on the sidelines and wait this title wait it out. just seeing things like that  ctg: i remember when you wanted to sign wayne before wayne took off. so you had that kind of vision. so who do you see now thats gonna be here in ten years have reached the level to get a shout out  jay: yeah these people im about to mention definitely reached the level. obviously j. cole drake absolutely  ay: kendrick  jay: kendrick as well. i think just he is talented very talented but just on sheer will and wanting it wale is gonna be here as well. i dont want to stretch. im sure other people but i dont wanna  envy: now you mentioned lil wayne i know that you guys were this close to signing wayne what happened to that deal i mean wayne was damn near saying he was rocafella and it just went left  jay: the truth is this is the first time i ever told this truth. the truth is after i had that the meeting with wayne umm you know i had a relationship with baby so you know i used to go to new orleans and i used to hang out with him and he had me in that purple little whatever that car was remember those purple little cars  envy: prowler  jay: prowler and you know going out in the street no top people wanting to jump in the car you know so i felt it was only right to call him you know i called him out of respect like yo i was talking to wayne just letting you know boom boom boom so after that i think we recieved a letter at our office for like torturous interference from their lawyer  ctg: wow.. they just do that  jay: it was like wow and it just all went from there. but you know i think i would rather you know lose that situation and do the right thing than the opposite. i think i couldve just.. signed him  ay: you couldve worked through it  jay: i couldve signed him and then told him after but you know i did the right thing. im cool with that decision  ctg: how close were you to really spanking wayne when he threw that shot at the wife  jay: ah.. nah. it was alright. its part of you know the sport and the competition. i didnt take it serious. i didnt view it as a threat you know. i thought it was just a flip of a line that i said because id said you aint got my wifey money. i wasnt really speaking to him but you know i guess he is holding the flag so he did the right thing for his camp and uh but i didnt take it as a real threat i took it as a flip of a line  ctg: now another hood question. people always say if biggie hadnt of passed hov wouldnt be here. i know youve heard that before  jay: thats just ridiculous. i mean i was here whilst biggie was here  ctg: some people say you made your best material when he was here  jay: i think just again like i said steel sharpens steel. the way we were working and the album that we were going to create together wouldve only made me better as a lyricist. and its just like you know theres thats gods plan. you know its gods plan. its just like saying biggie wouldnt be here if you know rakim hadnt been on the faith remix or  its like you can make up any scenario in your mind why a person shouldnt be here or a person wouldnt attain the success that they have but they i personally dont believe anybody couldve stopped me. i really thats just how i believe. it was gonna be i was coming. i was destined to be here. it just is what it is  ctg: why cant people give you that though why is it youve gotta be something else if big was here it wouldnt be like that hes in illuminati why cant you just be successful these days  jay: thats a very philosophical question. i can only assume cause i dont know the answer to that except that sometimes peoples success makes people feel instead of saying wow that person is successful and im inspired and some people are some people are like thats persons successful and imma strive and imma be exactly where they are. but some people are just like they have the reverse attitude like their success means my failure so i hate that success so i have to make some kind of explanation of why theyre here and why they shouldnt be here and why they wouldnt be here if this person was here. who thinks like that if you take that long to think if you take that long to think  ay: its not just black  ctg: its more so in hip hop culture  jay: if you take that long to think about someone and why they shoulodnt be here youre good and you should be doing something with that mentality. you should apply that intelligence to something else  ctg: aboslutely  jay: if that person were here that person.. you should be a scientist you need to figure out something that will really help us in the world  ay: now for you moving in to sports management does it feel to you like a lot of people dont want you to succeed cause it seems like thats a really tough business theres a lot of agents who feel like what does jay z know about sports management he hasnt done this and he hasnt done that  jay: yeah but they have that thing that you know that belief that they you could only do one thing. you know. we dont have that. we are not afflicted with that disease. you know i can walk and chew gum. its like its insane to even say that what does he know about sports uh.. everything more than you. you know and as far as business those guys have been theyve been uh theyve been sitting around just doing the typical thing right. theyre getting artists sometimes however they acquire the artist i dont want to do that to them. however they acquire their artist the athlete they get him and then they knock on the same doors. they do the nike they do the contract and they sit back they dont do anything else. so theyve been sitting around for 20-30 years just not doing anything  ay: same formula  jay: yeah. so we come in and thats a problem for them cause now they have to go to work now they have to wake up now they have to do things. they dont want me around cause now they have to do something for these athletes. and my whole thing is you know for the most part im gonna do more for the athlete than theyre gonna do for me at the end of the day. but uh i do this because its an extension of the bigger goal. the bigger goal is to you know for all artists to get their just dues. not you know these guys not to get half assed agents or people who rob them or people dont care about their finances. they dont even care about that thats why guys go broke in four years thats a shame. the average is 3-4 years we talking about guys who sign for $90 million $86 million are broke in 4 years thats terrible money management. because these guys dont care. they just taking whatever is gonna get them a cheque and theyre not even worrying about that. were doing all of that. we almost do that better were almost a better money management firm and then agents  ay: thats been a ongoing problem with sports  jay: yeah thats the thing theyre representation not caring about anything but their cheques  ay: artists as well  ctg: but then you have people saying well what does jay z know about money  all laughing  ay: yeah right  envy: nobody gonna say that  ay: is that something you do for all your artists as well is put them through some kind of financial training and set them up  jay: yeah. yes  ctg: when master p was here he said he would never do the agent thing again because athletes are too spoiled and theres really no money in the game. but i hear you saying theres a higher purpose. you wanna teach people how to keep their money  jay: yeah absolutely. yeah. not that its all like this philanthropic thing. its a business as well. but again you know im gonna contribute just as much or more to an athletes career than they can ever give me  ay: now why did you decide to get up out of def jam as president when you went over there to be president and then i kind of felt like you felt it wasnt right for you to be working at the label  ctg: he made way for peckers  jay: yeah. peckers was coming. ah.. you know more so i wanted to do more. i wanted to do more things than just sit there and make music. in that position i was in the position to force the artists career and just make money. and you know i was knocking on the doors of all the powers that be and i was like yo you dont understand i can do more. before the beats by dre i can do things like that. you know. i can you know i can identify companies we can go get billionare boys club this was before it was part of our thing. we need to get bbc you know its hot right now. all the artists want to wear it anyway. you know im giving these guys these elaborate not elaborate im giving these guys these simple business plans you know and it was just like nah no just bring some hits and i was like. then i gotta move on then because my time now is being wasted  ctg: you know if you walk around with that chain all day people gonna be asking whats the science. whats todays mathematics  jay: yeah. by the way this isnt even my chain i stole this from somebody. ty-ty will tell you as i walked in  ctg: uh oh  ay: you stealing chains now  jay: not really steal  ctg: does it mean anything to you though  jay: yeah. little bit  ctg: im with you  all laughing  jay: yeah  ctg: i dont like the conversation either. i call myself the god because i feel like it sometime. i still get little lessons but im not in to all..  jay: religion is like a personal computer you know. you let people in if you want to  ay: uh oh  jay: it is it truly is. you know how people look at your computer like this is a personal computer  ctg: thats what everybody says oh jay z with the new album oh jay z has such a god complex like a man cant reference god genesis 1:26 it says god created man in his image. so i cant reference myself a little bit every now and then as god  jay: absolutely. absolutely. were all gods  ay: beside sports what else do you watch on tv do you watch any of these reality shows  ctg: cause they dont think you do  jay: yeah. nah  ay: i know you used to watch sex and the city when that used to come on  jay: yeah and i still watch hbo i watch hbo and espn  ctg: you watch tv  jay: yeah  ay: he definitely watches sports obviously. hbo huh  jay: yeah  envy: you gotta watch nickelodeon  jay: nah i dont watch nickelodeon  ay: you dont watch girls or..  jay: nah its this little baby einsteins  envy: oh little baby einsteins  jay: thats always on  ctg: have you ever had to kick anybody out the room cause they approached you about doing a reality show  jay: nah thats never happened  ay: no-ones gonna asked you that  jay: no-one ever get that close to me. anyone with those type of question have  ctg: ty ty get the pepper spray asking me about some reality show  all laughing  jay: anyone with those type of questions will get vetted. theres no way.. theres 18 layers before that happens  envy: now how did you link back up with timbaland cause it seems like you were apart for a minute then all of a sudden it seems like you got him back smoking again  jay: yeah tim. me and tim have always been great but weve never been able to do more than like 1 record together  envy: cause it seems like hes been living in your house  jay: yeah yeah weve been together since the year started. you know basically. umm.. weve only been able to create like in small in small ugh time frames. like well do big pimpin and that was it. it was just like a personality thing it wasnt really clicking. but we always have like genuine love for each other but it just wasnt it just wasnt right. and then you know finally when he came back this time  envy: he was a little humbler he was humble  jay: hes actually more mature  envy: cause he changed  jay: yeah he was actually more like a different person. it was like i was looking at a different person the way he was like his conversation. i was like oh tims ready  envy: and what about just blaze  jay: what  envy: how is just blaze cause we heard you was working on some stuff with him we just havent heard anything as of yet  jay: yeah  ctg: he wants to know why just blaze isnt on the new album  jay: yeah we just didnt find that zone. and plus we the thing with just blaze and i is that we really have like records that people really care about. u dont know to psa so when were trying to make music were trying to beat that so thats its not like a blank sheet when he walks in the room. with timbaland we make big pimpin and dirt off your shoulder we can always you know those are hit records we can always find a zone you know. these are records that are like actually the foundation to my career. so were in there trying to beat those and thats going to be hard thats hard for us to do and that takes time. and im not in one place and hes certainly not focused as well. hes doing his dj thing and you know whatever hes working on so its hard to we need time  envy: just get focused out there just  ctg: have you ever thought  jay: me too im not just putting it on him. we both need to focus if were gonna do something thats gonna stand up to those records  ctg: have you ever thought about doing any charity and doing like a rocafella reunion  envy: he say doing charity..  ctg: you know like state property beanie sigel free  jay: im not really in to you know those. truly the past is the past. you know well do shows together like philly last year where it makes sense but im not really trying to recreate the past. it can never be what it was you know. that time was that time or moment it was special. that never works. that i dont know if its ever worked. im trying to think and its not really coming to me right now. i dont know if thats ever worked where you try to recreate something. people just start looking like youre a little slower your moves aint the same you know what im saying youre doing the same moves but they arent the same  envy: also justin timberlake. you did an interview and said he asked you to be on the record a while ago and you kind of was like nah its not that time ay: next album  envy: and he was like i will never use jay again and then maybe a couple months later we heard his record with you on it. did you have to talk about that first like you played me or it was just  jay: nah. you know everyone has to respect everyones choice and time. it just wasnt the time for us to link up yet. you know and you know it just time is just now. but it was no real deep conversation about it we just was in the studio and we just made some music  ctg: another hood question. young chris your former artists. how much did he influence you cause a lot of people say you took his style or he took yours or  jay: well you know well ive made records with all due respect to chris he was an amazing artist. you know he did amazing things. but the music is there. i made records before chris and after him. you know so i dont even know how to answer that. its like the weirdest thing in the world to me. i dont knoiw  ctg: youve heard this stuff before though  jay: yeah of course no no no no no i heard it  ay: charlamagne just over here like  ctg: i dont want to get fired  ay: ive never heard that before  jay: its just weird to me like really  ctg: i get pulled in the office why did you ask jay that its been on the internet for years  ay: now have you hit robert deniro back yet i know he was trying to reach you so  jay: who  envy: robert deniro  jay: no i havent  envy: hes mad. hes pretty mad too  all laughing  ay: how do you duck robert deniro  jay: uh.. eh  all laughing  ctg: how do you get to the point in your life where you can curve robert deniro  ay: hes the spin  jay: eh. you know. i treat people based on who they are. you know who they really are. like not their name not robert deniro. you know who you are as a person and thats just it doesnt matter who you are. everyone has to be respectful and everyone has to be you know a human being. thats you know no-ones above you know  ay: the spin  envy: the curve  ctg: respect the fact that i am hov with 18 layers theres 18 people you have to talk to before i will talk to you  jay: no not in that way. the curve. but yes..  all laughing  jay: its just you know we all human being and we all have to respectful to one another and thats just the end of it. and thats how i am with anybody  ctg: now is there any rumour that you ever heard that made you be like aiight this is weird  ay: all of them  jay: all the time. which one who you wanna start with  ctg: like when they said beyonce didnt really have the baby  jay: thats a good one. thats probably the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard and the fact that people were really like running with that and running up with it and following up with it. cause at first i thought it was one of those you know get press things like you know lets run with this to get press. then i was slowly like.. oh yall believe this it start going so far like yall really believe this and thats really messed up cause like the time when youre supposed to be the most joyous youve got life in you you know the whole thing is supposed to be a joyous time for you. whether you say you care about it or not is annoying. and you shouldnt have to really deeal with that as a human being. but you know thats the position that were in. dont feel sorry..  all laughing  ctg: how do you keep from responding to certain things cause everyone always says ok i gotta jay z this situation and not say nothing. like you always seem to keep your cool and not respond to bs thats out there  jay: it doesnt matter it really doesnt matter. cause you know when youre not in control of the outcome. it dont matter what i say it dont matter how many time i say that beyonce is really pregnant people gonna believe what they want to believe anyway so why waste my time  ay: and sometimes you respond to something and it brings way more attention to it  jay: that too. it goes in to another space like are you not listening to me  ctg: then youll have somebody say jay z how do you know beyonce is pregnant  all laughing  jay: i checked laughing  envy: well the album is in stores right now. we appreciate you stopping through. now some of the lyrics on the album this is something the intern pulled up when she was going through it  ay: now dont try and put this on somebody else envy  envy: she was talking about beyonce cheating on you. and i guess on the lyric you say keep cheating on me i take you back  ctg: alright. he about to get fired  jay: nah. that record is about fame laughing see thats what i mean  envy: thats why were asking i dont want to get fired  ay: thats why dj shrimp is asking  jay: its ok  all laughing  ctg: he dont envy: i dont want to get fired or pepper sprayed emory just turned around im just making sure  jay: that song is about fame. you know and its about the way fame is fleeting you know. the holy grail meaning you chase this thing and these bright lights and these cameras and you look back and you want everything and you end up with nothing. so at some point you have to stop yourself. so that whole first verse is me complaining about it. you know the fame she cheats on me you know she hangs out with kanye and drake and j. cole and then what i do i took her back. you know when its my turn i take her back. the whole thing about fame. the second verse is about.. you know. fuck fame. its not really about anything so i start to rationalise and it it says. people dying back from where i am from. putting it in perspective like i dont care about this like people got real life problems where i live. where i grew up. people are dying and getting shot daily. you know like 40 something people got shot in chicago what i care about being on envys show  envy: its a good show  jay: you know what im saying like lets put it all in perspective. i got a good life i got a great life you know whatever comes with it even the ridiculous rumours about anything its nothing compared to what to where ive been  ay: is it crazy for you going back to bed stuy and marcy and seeing how different the neighbourhood is now  jay: yeah theres like condos these huge condos  ay: its expensive to live there  jay: theres like these huge condos right across the street. i got a great story for that. i forget what album it was maybe 2 or three albums ago. the guy who does the sample came to the studio he was like yeah i bought a great condo right across the street from marcy projects. i was like.. i dont get it you know he had a great job a great position he was making good money and i was like why does he live across the street from marcy projects then he was like he came back a couple of days later he was like yeah we moved.. he said at night time you know his wife was pregnant he said at night time we heard bow bow we thought it was fire crackers but it kept going bow bow he went and saw the apartment in the day time. so thats a bit of advice for everybody else..  all laughing  ay: you have to ride through at night and when its hot out thats when you really can tell what a neighbourhood is like. cause im looking at bedstuy and everything is over a $1 million and it never its crazy  jay: yeah  ctg: my final question what you said fuck fame you ever have that conversation with ye like ye its just the paparrazzi thats not a real problem  jay: yeah all the time  ctg: ok. thats an answer  envy: when you see him hit his head on that stop sign did you laugh  jay: i chuckled  ay: when you saw charlamagne getting chased outside the building did you laugh  ctg: that was pretty funny  jay: that was. i laughed really hard  ctg: listen you gotta see the other video  envy: theres no other video  ctg: theres another video. listen some cats tried to get me in the store on the surviellance video  ay: no one cat not some cats  envy: 1 guy  kay: the thing i liked about it cause you cant help that. some cat just run up on you and knock you upside your head it just is  ctg: im shocked  jay: i know it is what it is. that can happen to anybody. you saw it coming..  envy: he seen it  jay: that was then i saw i was like ok. that was little nuances of your personality. you saw it coming you knew that thing was coming  ctg: you know what gave it away though the camera. worldstar. nothing good is gonna come of this situation. im getting out of here im not letting these guys come through they mightve peed on me or something  all laughing  envy: ladies and gentleman jay z its the breakfast club its power 105.1  "]}
