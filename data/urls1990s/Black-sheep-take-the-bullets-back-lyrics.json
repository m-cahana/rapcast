{"black sheep ": ["  these walls are comin down this house it aint a home youre knockin at the door pretending youre the saviour  i dont believe a word so many have been hurt but still it seems that you only try to ignore  dont shut your eyes see what you have done see the world outside and stop telling lies youve gone too far who do you think you are so take the bullets back take the bullets back just take them back  now were livin in the streets the truth beneath our feet the sky has turned from blue to grey were gonna change it  everything we got you took it and you shot but now were gonna stop you youre losing control  dont shut...  i miss my sister cause she is gone with the sun and i miss my brother cause he is gone with the sun  my sister she is gone she is gone  dont shut...
