{"wu-tang clan ": ["", "   two individuals pulled from a lake inside a vehicle one had his foot on the brake the windows was fully up and the doors was locked the news made the headline and the town was shocked the driver was clutching a can of hi-c his jacket was tied to a nearby tree his jeans had dye in them an unusual tattoo was the only hope to identifying them the autopsies revealed gun shot wounds dental records matched to a newlywed groom this accident was a cover up for homicide two who mightve stayed alive from paying bribes sheets investigators had relied on the media for help and to track down the perpetrators they canvassed the neighborhood with standard procedure and visited the home of a topless skeezer who was at the bar when he was last seen alive left with him just ten minutes after they arrived despite the police efforts they turned up nothing just an ex-hooker trynna get a rep from bluffing but the wide publicity had just paid off from a hard rock inmate who was just made soft he said he knew a man who killed the pop star and almost got caught by a passing cop car the inmate said probably the motive was robbery and knowing this and keeping it a secret it bothers me he said this individual killed for low billings and purchased a murder kit blocks from the killing the sheriffs office had no time to waste plus the inmate made a deal to avoid the case so he co-operated fully and snitched on his chop shop mechanic who used to move bodies on the pulley an extortionist involved in similar incidents payments that came in thousand dollar increments suspicious activities that flooded the place so they subpoenaed phone records for the calls was traced the hair that was taken from his car interior was that of a young girl who felt inferior she died fighting and probably aroused his anger holding off her life as she faced the strangler the crime seemed to be sexual from nature it was substantial evidence that the nigga raped her the suspects had marks on his face and chest but it just wasnt enough to get an arrest asked of his whereabouts on the third of july said he partied with his friends and had a solid alibi but it was really something left at the scene on a small scale was the microscopic traces of blood under her fingernails  "]}
