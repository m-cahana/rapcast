{"digable planets": ["  after stretching the limits of jazz/hip-hop digable planets are poised for yet another journey into retro mode.where did the confusion begin was it that digable planets met all the aesthetic criteria for mass media consumption: they were videogenic co-ed politically correct. they even reeked of indo smoke but didnt seem to inhale.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0was it the new york times calling them bohemians the l.a. times comparing them to the preeminent art rock band talking heads or being token window dressing for the ultra-whitemans magazine details  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0was it the austere black and white video rebirth shot in a smoky beatnik lounge before a united nations of faces\u2014in a colorless world are we all supposed to be the same  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0could it have been the source feature on digable planets written in ishmaels words by that herb-ass-nigger a dreamy fictionalized episode where the writer rambles on about slackers izzy and ahmad and a search for black identity  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the many allusions to insect cosmogony\u2014butterfly ish doodlebug c-know and ladybug mecca\u2014didnt help matters. instead of hip-hop lauding them for their inventive and smart rap they were admonished for not being hard enough or keepin it real. but what are the children of a college professor and free-thinking radicals to do  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by the time the second single nickel bags was dropped the reign of the insects was over\u2014a streetlevel backlash hit them like raiddd. all the attention and heavy-heavy commercial rotation had created an im-tired-a-dose-niggas sentiment among hip-hop acolytes. needless to say nickel bags did miserably.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0finally the opportunity arose for digables to assert their true sociopolitical ideology ishamel did so\u2014bkyn style. at the 94 grammy awards ceremony millions of home viewers were caught off guard by ishmaels black nationalist stance on live television:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wed like for everybody to think about the people right outside this door thats homeless as youre sittin in these $900 and $300 seats. they not out there eatin at all. also wed like to say to the universal black family one day were gonna recognize our true enemy and were gonna stop attackin each other maybe then well get some changes goin on\u2026so peace to the gods and earth and the nation of islam digable planets say peace.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the impact of his radical oratory: mainstream sponsors were pissed off the resolve of their hip-hop detractors was strengthened. instead of being ass-out in amerikkka like so many other genre bending hip-hoppers disposable heroes of hip-hop gumbo del the funkee homosapien digable hopped on the next flight to europe and got paid very paid.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with a cloud of skepticism from urban hardheads hovering above them its amazing digables havent taken more extreme measures to ensure their new album blowout comb receives an unbiased listen. they could just go the way of another musician \u2013 we all love but dont always understand \u2013 who feels the same way.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maybe for their new releases we should refer to them as the group formerly known as digable planets. borough of dreams\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0its an early summer morning from the subway car window it looks like rain. im on my way to ishmael butlers apartment. its entirely fitting that ish should call brooklyn home. in recent years brooklyn has become a fertile seedbed for black aesthetes: writers poets musicians filmmakers and rappers have all flocked to the new black mecca. peep borough check a paean to brooklyn living.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in front of his brownstone apartment im greeted by his cheery publicist and his precocious 4-year-old daughter dania. we enter. piquant incense burns mellow jazz warms his living room and kitchen. vinyl records numbering in the hundreds are as much a part of the d\u00e9cor as tools of the trade for a rapper-producer. a small book case stands across from where i eventually sit. the names marx mao and the panthers are intermingled.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0who shaped your reading tastes  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0my parents were revolutionaries ishmael flatly states.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in what sense; arm chair or hands on  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a sly grin forms they were definitely hand on.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0his voice hints on other regional influences. when rapping or speaking his voice often takes on a south central drawl while his cadence leans more towards uptown bravado. i grew up all over the place\u2026oakland seattle new york d.c. maryland\u2026we moved around a lot.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0after instructing his daughter to play quietly in the back he reclines in an armchair to my left he rocks back and forth. his hair stands on-end in a lumpy don king-esque fro. hes pragmatic; has no visible attachment to material goods: theres no fly ride or boomin home system. his only luxury items are on his feet\u2014newly acquired black high-top adidas. he speaks in a soft man of the people tone. what he believes he pushes on us; not through verbal manipulation but through singling out a common experience. in his rap ish steers toward the philosophical ideologies of marxism socialism which strongly support equal distribution of wealth and power. he approaches music the same way.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on blowout comb each cut has been thoughtfully measured out: beats never muscle out melody dog it nor does the rhyming bog down the rhythmic ease jettin. live instruments are allowed to flow in an open-ended fashion. a guitar weaves in and out of black ego. a frantic trombone calls-and-responds to the friendly word play of k.b.s alley.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we recorded all the songs at seven minutes and cut them down from there. i wanted to get back to the jazz feel when they had like twelve minute songs he explains. you got a better feel for the music the musicians had more time to think out what they were doing.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whoaaa there goes that word again jazz. the thing that caused such a big stink in the first place. ish sits up when i bring it to his attention we were just pulling musical ideas from jazz records. we had no other use for jazz other than to sample it. i pull from jazz because its what i grew up on\u2026. along with a bunch other stuff.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0c-knowledge eventually ambles in from an all night party i should know i was there. he slides in beside me on the sofa and we laugh for a minute about the sugar hill gangs performance at the party. twenty years down the line they might be us theyll be calling us old school artists or people might change their mind and well be new again like them chuckles knowledge.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he doesnt say too much after that or too much any other time. while articulate hes not very talkative.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but the mention of old school hip-hop has them as excitable as ishs daughter who runs in from the other room and jumps in his lap. they recite lines from an old busy-bee album revealing an affinity for old school then collapse in laughter.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a few rhymes later.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0why dont people listen to old school hip-hop like say vintage jazz its not old enough yet. a lot of hip-hop vocals are turned up really loud rappers ride off the appeal and novelty of the lyrics. but it should be a combination of both music and lyrics ishmael opines.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is this why a majority of vocals on the album seem low vocals pan from left earphone to right and from right to left. the choruses are radio-friendly but verses lapse into stylish mumbling understanding the lyrics almost become a chore. they didnt print lyrics in refutations; and theyre not doing it for blowout either.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as to whether digables have accepted the pitfalls of esoteric rap in a rigid hip-hop environment is questionable. if youre preaching or being artsy a bit of advice: do it sparingly. here are two good reasons why; a arrested developments zingalamaduni b public enemys muse sick n our mess age.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0i think it has more to do with longevity. i dont think the vocals are low but i could see where someone would say that. if you listen to it you get whats being said. and over time it becomes revealing. if you like it youll listen to it more. if you dont; you wont. but if you it youll put it on next year and be like oh thats what that nigger said. meccalude\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0after much ado mecca and i decide where to eat. the first place wasnt quite right. the second was inside; she wanted to be out. all i was thinking was r. kelly\u2014my stomachs calling. we sit outside. im starting to think this must be the way it is within the group. the woman always gets her way or at least her say. for each suggestion i make she responds with a smile that makes me self-conscious. she wields her sexuality as a weapon. i am unarmed.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as the youngest member of the group and of course its only female. one would think she viewed ish and c-know as patriarchs. not so  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ive learned a lot from them but theyre not like my father or anything my father is my father theyre just my friends she asserts. but it would be hard to imagine these past couple of years without them. theyve helped me out and taught me a lot.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we leave the restaurant meander around lower manhatten in greenwich village discussing life music the state of black people. there are the usual street vendors recently converted muslims hawking pungent incense fragrant oils and islamic literature. each one voluntarily offers his own conspiratorial take on the o.j. trial. crossing over to the east village. we witness our second street fight. oddly enough theres a full moon out. were constantly accusted by homeless men and women with any number of requests: do you have a penny please help me get some food im trying to get enough money for a beer when i bump into an old acquaintance. i make the introduction. we rap for a minute; mecca and i move on.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0were almost a block away when he yells back apparently from the shock of seeing me with a rap star a cute one at that. oh shit todd thats you. mecca smiles he must have recognized me or something.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we resume our talk about the new outkast album and her role as one of the few female emcees on the scene. much of what she says is punctuated by fuck that or fuck dem. you gotta give her points for keepin it real.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0since her debut on rebirth shes streamlined her leftist posturing with 70s styled black nationalism: i raise every day for the mass/ pump my fist right up against the fascist. she continues with an aside to her intellectual influences bell hooks derrick bell and reggie butler.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the black power stuff sounds good but for mecca its something new. shes changed a lot since her formative years in maryland. the daughter of colombian parents ethnic pride wasnt stressed at home. she freely admits to being somewhat white-washed during childhood. her straight hair and light complexion made it easier for her to be accepted by white classmates. when her best-friend a white girl called her a nigger thats when she realized she wasnt just one of the girls. after that i kicked her ass\u2026bad\u2026and started hanging with black people she bitterly recalls.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0her honesty at this moment of vulnerability humanizes her. if possible she becomes even more attractive. i consider the evening watching her walk towards the train station. shes pretty cool for a pop-rap star. the shape of cool to come\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cool like dat expanded hip-hops hegemony dragging it into previously unexpected terrain; an alternative rap group had come along with whip appeal for progressives forty-acres-and-a-mulers and afrocentric utopians. embracing the 50s era miles davis cool aesthetic digables strategy of eschewing post-reagan-induced black nihilism and black-on-black rage set them philosophically apart from the hip-hop mainstream. maybe their only crime was in believing that the african-american community had progressed beyond the point of pitting brothers-and-sisters against one another. believe it or not; snoop dogg and jazz trumpeter wynton marsalis have more in common than what separates them.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0raising the stakes again digable serves up a heaping helping of 90s realpolitik 9th wonder blakitolism rather than the over-the-counter freeze-dried consciousness peddled on mtv. fuck the environment; save the people.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0blowout comb teems with references to fascism socialism and redistributing wealth. are these big ideas for three undersized rappers to be pushing yes. but taking on issues larger than you\u2014civil rights destruction of the black family\u2014is as african-american as sweet potato pie.
