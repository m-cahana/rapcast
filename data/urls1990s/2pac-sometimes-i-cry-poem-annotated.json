{"az ": ["  sometimes when im alone i cry because im on my own the tears i cry r bitter and warm they flow with life but take no form i cry because my heart is torn and i find it difficult 2 carry on if i had an ear 2 confide in i would cry among my treasured friends but who do u know that stops that long to help another carry on the world moves fast and it would rather pass u by than 2 stop and c what makes u cry its painful and sad and sometimes i cry and no one cares about why.
