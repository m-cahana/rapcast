{"o.c.": ["  on the real though donald trump. how is it interesting that these shootings happened in a country thats tough on guns tell us don because it sounds like that vacuous observation was about giving your nra-loving constituency a handjob and spinning a tragedy for political gain and im thinking maybe using a situation where dozens of innocents have just been murdered in the streets isnt the best time. no  love to paris and any individual or family whos lost loved ones to evil anywhere in this world. chill w/ the angels.
