{"lauryn hill": ["  i remember when you look into my eyes you saw right through me and i could not hide i was exposed just like a child all of my heart you hold it in your hands im yours to command im yours to demand i i feel so humble with you in my life with you in my life  i remember when i looked into your eyes i saw a reflection of myself and i could not lie out of control too weak to deny all of myself is naked before you but what can i do there is nothing i can do i feel so beautiful with you in my life with you in my life  i remember i remember i remember i ohh ohh ohh with you in my life with you in my life  "]}
