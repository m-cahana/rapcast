{"o.c.": ["  []  frank: yeah.  jay-z: i just dont know...  frank: yeah yeah.  jay-z:take radio for instance. its pretty much an advertisement model. you take these pop stations theyre reaching 18-34 young white females. so theyre playing music based on those tastes. and then theyre taking those numbers and theyre going to advertising agencies and people are paying numbers based on the audience that they have. so these places are not even based on music. their playlist isnt based on music. if you think a person like bob marley right now probably wouldnt play on a pop station. which is crazy. its not even about the dj discovering what music is best. you know music is music. the lines just been separated so much that were lost at this point in time. they have to revolutionize that thing you know be more progressive. i think with all the technology and where we are today its definitely a more efficient way to get music out.  because its the whole idea behind having a festival that played all sorts of music. because no one listens to music like that - you just listen to music more than ever. back in the days there used to be hip-hop clubs. like specific hip-hop clubs. now every club is a hip-hop club. every club is a music club. you go in there youre liable to hear edm hip-hop youre gonna hear some soul youre definitely going to hear poison around 2-3 in the morning.  its unfortunate because with you know technology and everything moving forward we should it should be a better way that the music the musicians radio and these things that are supposed to be instruments for the arts should exist. and it shouldnt be about advertisement. and it shouldnt be about\u2014so the more times you know someone like yourself can bypass that its better for the for the arts. and its better for the audience cause you have to have like a level of discipline and just a belief to put music out in this place where not everyone can.  frank: right.  jay-z: you know people like they wanna shoot for that and then theyre making music thats not really conditioned who they are so they can reach a certain platform.
