{"the pharcyde": ["  now in my younger days i used to sport a shag when i went to school i carried lunch in a bag with an apple for my teacher cause i knew id get a kiss always got mad when the class was dismissed but when it was in session i always had a question i would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and help me with my problem it was never much just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch oh how i wish i could hold her hand and give her a hug she was married to the man he was a thug his name was lee he drove a z head pick her up from school promptly at three oclock i was on her jock yes indeedy i wrote graffiti on the bus first id write her name then carve a plus with my name last on the looking glass i seen her yesterday but still i had to let her pass  she keeps on passing me by she keeps on passing  when i dream of fairy tales i think of me and shelly see shes my type of hype and i cant stand when brothers tell me that i should quit chasing and look for something better but the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter i havent gone as far as asking if i could get with her i just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture im shooting for her heart got my finger on the trigger she could be my broad and i could be her nigga but all i can do is stare back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare now shes more sophisticated highly edu-ma-cated not at all over-rated i think i need a prayer to get in her boots and it looks rather dry i guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye although shes crazy stepping ill try to stop her stride cause i wont have no more of this passing me by  and i must voice my opinion of not even pretending she didnt have me strung like a chicken chase my tail like a doggie she was kind of like a star thinking i was like a fan dude she looked good down side she had a man he was a rooty-toot a nincompoop she told me soon your little birdies gonna fly the coop she was a flake like corn and i was born not to understand by letting her pass i had proved to be a better man  she keeps on passing me by she keeps on passing  now there she goes again the dopest ethiopian and now the world around me be gets moving in slow motion when-ever she happens to walk by why does the apple of my eye overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much i try wait no i did not really pursue my little princess with persistance and i was so low-key that she was unaware of my existance from a distance i desired secretly admired her wired her a letter to get her and it went my dear my dear my dear you do not know me but i know you very well now let me tell you about the feelings i have for you when i try or make some sort of attempt i symp damn i wish i wasnt such a wimp cause then i would let you know that i love you so and if i was your man then i would be true the only lying i would do is in the bed with you then i signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly ps love me tender the letter came back three days later return to sender damn  she keeps on passing me by she keeps on passing  "]}
