{"jay-z": [" when somebody like harry belafonte makes a comment you get offended by that.  ", " im offended by that because first of all and this is gonna sound arrogant but my presence is charity just who i am just like obamas is obama provides hope whether he does anything the hope that he provides for a nation and outside of america is enough. know what im saying just being who he is. hes the first black president. if he speaks on any issue or anything he should be left alone. im not gonna say anything bad about him. of course were gonna challenge him to do better but i felt that belafonte just went about it wrong the way he did it in the media and then bigged up bruce springsteen or somebody and it was like whoa you just sent the wrong message all the way around. you know what im saying you bigged up--bruce springsteen is a great guy you know what i mean--you a civil rights activist and you just bigged up the white guy against me in the white media. and im not saying that in a racial way im just saying what is the facts of what it was. and it was like that was the wrong way to go about it.  ", " today president obama made a statement about trayvon martin...  ", " amazing amazing amazing. because its hard in politics to really just make a statement as a human. i felt today he was very admirable because he made a statement as a father and as a black man and as someone who had compassion for the things that we go through because hes been through it before. its certainly not normal. you know a politician is not supposed to speak like that.  ", " he went out of his way to address it...  ", " no not address it; he really gave facts about clutching purses. weve never heard that we never heard that come out of a presidents mouth. you know so that was big really admirable. i really have another level of respect for him to be in that position and make that stance because thats what i want to do i want to be in this position and still talk about whats right and wrong. im not gonna always be right; im not gonna always do the right thing. but im trying. thats my whole goal is to maintain a sense of myself and also i want to represent us. i want to represent us in a way weve never been represented before.  ", " what are your thoughts on trayvon  ", " i was really angry. i didnt sleep for two days. i was really angry about it. we all knew there was still a bit of racism in america but for it to be so blatant was\u2026 if you just asked the questions asked yourself the question didnt trayvon have a right to stand his ground he was being chased he was being chased and he fought back. he mightve won that doesnt mean hes a criminal. he won. if you chase me and you try to attack me and i defend myself how can i be in the wrong this guy went to get skittles and go back and watch the all-star game. he had plans. get an arizona and get the skittles and watch the game. you know he probably had his whole position...he had no intentions of robbing anyones home. you know so its just a thing where again a reminder that we still have a long way to go. its beautiful now because this generation they dont see color in that way. were a bit removed from those racist feelings because again its hard to teach racism when your child is out...you know our clubs is integrated the music we listen to is the same.
