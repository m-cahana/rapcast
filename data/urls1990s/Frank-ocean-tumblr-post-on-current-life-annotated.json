{"o.c.": ["  ive been meaning to write you more. different hotels every night arent so bad really. in fact- all the moving house could inspire a photo series.. not for the gram knowing me its probably only for whoever controls my estate in the future and enthusiastically develops all the rolls of film i forgot to. im in belgium just 7 concerts into a tour with an ambiguous ending. id tour for a year if it didnt interrupt my recording or my weekend driving. i really wanted to go to cairo in between europe and australia.. might let things settle some.. go to south africa instead and place some flowers on a gate for the president.for being epic and 94. i write on paper at night. my tour manager gave me a small powder blue book at the beginning of this run with gold embossed lettering on the cover that reads one line a day.. its easier than youd think to narrow the entire cinema of your day into one sentence. i never read them back in the morning. whenever morning is.. even my macbook clock cant keep up. all the travel isnt in support of an album or anything like that really- past or ahead. theres no label or touring firm dollars involved. all pennies from my pocket. in support of some odd daydream. ops to photograph crowds and clouds from planes. contrast all the quiet with some noise. new noise and old noise..sober crowd faaded crowd. all welcome.
