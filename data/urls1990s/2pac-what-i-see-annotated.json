{"az ": ["  with my eyes closed i can c we have a chance 2 discover ecstasy but the clouds of doubt have made u blind but the clouds of doubt have made u blind so u r afraid of the emotions that u may find i know that uve been hurt before but this is no excuse 4 u 2 ignore the seed that cupid planted in hopes that we would sow this infant emotion deserves 2 breathe so why wont u let it grow a neglected flower will wither and on its own it will surely die but with honesty passion and mutual respect we can soar beyond the sky so please dont follow what u c follow the rhythm within your heart believe in me though u cannot c what lies within the dark  "]}
