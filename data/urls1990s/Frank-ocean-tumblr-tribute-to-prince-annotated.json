{"o.c.": ["  im not even gonna say rest in peace because its bigger than death. i never met the man i was too nervous the one time i saw him and i never saw him play live regrettably i only know the legends ive heard from folks and what ive heard and seen from his deep catalog of propellant fearless virtuosic work.  my assessment is that he learned early on how little value to assign to someone elses opinion of you.. an infectious sentiment that seemed soaked into his clothes his hair his walk his guitar and his primal scream. he wrote my favorite song of all time when you were mine. its a simple song with a simple melody that makes you wish you thought of it first even though you never would have - a flirtatious brand of genius that feels approachable.  he was a straight black man who played his first televised set in bikini bottoms and knee high heeled boots epic. he made me feel more comfortable with how i identify sexually simply by his display of freedom from and irreverence for obviously archaic ideas like gender conformity etc. he moved me to be more daring and intuitive with my own work by his demonstration - his denial of the prevailing model...his fight for his intellectual property - slave written across the forehead name changed to a symbol... an all out rebellion against exploitation.  a vanguard and genius by every metric i know of who affected many in a way that will outrun oblivion for a long while. im proud to be a prince fanstan for life.
