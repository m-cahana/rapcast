{"o.c.": ["  home. i put my bag down. leave my shoes where they land. pull my shirt over my head. hang it on the ironing board. fall into this white nautica comforter my mom bought from marshalls when she came in town to see me last. home is currently in beverly hills. a well executed renovation project not far from wilshire theatre. i like this place. rents two grand. expensive. refrigerators stainless. countertops are granite. living room floors are travertine. bedroom floors are hardwood. its a nice space. beige walls with nothing on them. but an ignorant television or two. a mural i did by hand when i was heartbroken and a completely arbitrary photo of odb in the bathroom above the toilet. my favorite piece. i got one closet and more articles of clothing than i need or wear. options are good. ive never been notably organized or tidy. so a large percentage of my wardrobe is usually strewn across my bed or that aforementioned ironing board. i keep my bathroom clean. kitchen too sort of. i eat out so much that the only issue i really have is perishables perishing in the icebox. oh and my fish died recently. i still havent emptied his tank. damn. a nice lady named mayra comes by a couple times a month and cleans up for me. its the best eighty dollars i spend everytime. i built out a project studio in my living room. the mess of wires is starting to become a nuisance though. ive probably recorded at home less times than i can count on my hands. i have made a couple beats though. beats which ive played for no one but frank. im reading three books at once. well not really. but you get it. which one i pick up at the end of my night sort of depends on my mood. im furthest along in the one about an african kid who moves to america after his family is killed and his country is destroyed by civil war. his story is hardly imaginable. i appreciate the relative calm in my life by the time i put it down. i used to be addicted to cnn. nowadays my tv is either off or being used as a monitor for my mac in the living room. except on sunday nights when entourage is in season. i read magazines a lot. theyre my favorite. i have no subscriptions. last time i counted i had near a thousand bucks worth of magazines stacked next to my sofa. newsstands must love me. im impulsive as fuck. damn. thats bad. im gonna try and subscribe online somewhere or something. ive got a lot of music here too. lately ive been going to amoeba and buying oldies but goodies that id never heard before. i must admit those have been my most wise purchases this summer. smarter than my car note for sure. sades love deluxe might indirectly buy me a g550 one day. a house to park it in front of too probably. no bullshit. ill sleep now. maybe i wont wake up till morning. maybe ill wake up shortly. either way ill pray. and ill dream.
