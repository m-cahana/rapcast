{"az ": ["  when i was alone and had nothing i asked 4 a friend 2 help me bear the pain no one came except . . . god  when i needed a breath 2 rise from my sleep no one could help me except . . . god  when all i saw was sadness and i needed answers no one heard me except . . . . god  so when im asked who i give my unconditional love 2 look for no other name except . . . god  "]}
