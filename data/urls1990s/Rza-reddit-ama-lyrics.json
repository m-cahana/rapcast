{"rza": ["   1. can you describe what the reaction was from everyone was after inspectah deck first laid down his verse in triumph  rza - he slayed it. and everybody knew it. and everybody else tried to slay. but he slayed it 2. did ol dirty really live up to the craziness that he portrayed in his music   rza - times ten 3. what happened first you naming yourself rza or your cousin naming himself gza  rza - i named myself the rza first and i named him the gza shortly thereafter 4. did anything inspire you with regards to the choice of beats on enter the 36 chambers also are you still an avid chess player :d  rza - on 36 chambers i kind of went on my own inspiration. i was out to prove my abilities. yes i still play chess 5. will we ever get 36 chambers remastered  rza - perhaps some of the tracks will be remastered. a lot of them are probably not in multitrack form anymore. so the remaster would still have to come from a stereo mix 6. ever give any thought to writing/directing a wu tang clan movie to tie in with an album  rza - yes actually. although making movies is very difficult and its hard to get green lights im going to keep pushing though. and maybe one day it will see the light 7. do i still have to protect ma neck its been like 20 years now im getting tired of doing it love you man. as a producer as a rapper as an actor as a videogame character any dj  rza - you have to protect ya neck til the day you drop brother. because if you lose ya neck that will be the day you drop you must always protect ya neck at all times 8. long time fan of the wu. i was amazed by the kill bill soundtracks dont know if you can answer this: will the ghostface/mf doom album ever be released  rza - i dont know. but ghost is one of the dopest mcs and mf is a dope producer and mc. so im sure if they do it its going to be great 9. whats your favorite movie and why is it how high  rza - hahahahaheeehohohahaha. lay off the drugs cat. lol 10. i have some beat production related questions: - whats your usual setup all digital any analog instruments vinyl sampling   - what daw do you prefer -do you make beats then send the finished product to rappers to write lyrics to it or do you usually write the song together - do you have a specific process for finding samples or is it all gut feeling  rza - well thats a lot but: not being egotistic about this but i have a dozen set ups. and my home studio i use different rooms for setups. so one room is just turntables and a sampler another would be just keyboards another will be a digital room theres one room where everything is analog live drums guitars etc. as a composer you always need different sounds so after working with hans zimmer ive learned to use different rooms to write different things or different scenes  i prefer writing songs together. in fact one of the problems with making a wu-tang album is my refusal to send beats because i believe that great music is created when people are in a room together  i dig and i dig and if something strikes my ear i sample it. then i twist it 11. peace do you still wear those pointy ass rings and have you ever actually punched a hole in a crabs hand with them  rza - no. i gave them to my little brother and i think he lost em 12. do you need to be self aware in order to have sex for enjoyment  rza - uh oh. its getting deep on ama. we said amaa. but now that you asked you better be aware of yourself and your partners 13. how did you like your time on californication samurai apocalypse was a great foil to hank moody  rza - it was very fun. funny. and something was very sexy about that show. maybe it was meagan. lol 14. hey rza tell us some funny stories from u and the guys in wu tang:   rza - heres a story it may not be funny depending on your point of view but one time the whole clan was in atlanta and i guess we caused some kind of riot in the building and thus the police was brought in to end the show. i remember everybody getting away from the cops without any violence but one cop had got a grab of inspector deck and he couldnt get free. when we noticed it me and method man rushed back over to help but actually what could we do we cant hit a cop could we that would not have been wise. instead method man grabbed onto inspector decks arm and combined his strength with inspector deck which allowed them to get away from the cop they broke his grip and we all ran. i later told meth that was some wu-tang kung fu shit right there. 15. how was working with earl sweatshirt ive heard that during the making of molasses you spit a freestyle for three hours  rza - yeah we got zoned out that night. hes a cool cat. and i think he will be a great talent in hiphop 16. hey rza how did you become a vegetarian  rza - i just snapped out of eating dead animals 17. bong bong been a fan for 20+ years 2 questions: whats your all time favorite martial arts flick what is your favorite odb verse/line/metaphor/song  rza -

hahahahahahaha. all i can say is that i had the hiphop chess belt 19. what was it about gravediggaz and the horrorcore genre in general that appealed to you when it was first starting  rza - at the time being young and thinking of my childhood nightmares i wanted to write songs from the darker side of my mentality. i feel like the gravediggaz are the pioneers of this mentality of lyricism. hiphop could use a few more doses of it now 20. hey rza you seem to be a very calculated meditative and for lack of a better word spiritual person. was there a certain event in your life that led you to be this way or is this the way youve always been peace & thanks for the ama  rza - yes certain events led me to this which is hard for me to describe to this which are hard to describe. but i can say that it was a growth process. would you believe i was once obnoxious 21. can you share any memories of your tour with rage against the machine  rza - that was one of the highlights of my career. at the time wu-tang had the #1 album in the country and we began playing some of the biggest venues that we had to that date. one of my best memories is when zack broke his leg on tour and needed a little energy during the new jersey show and i came out and rocked the stage with him. the rest of the wu went home. : 22. have you considered being on the joe rogan experience podcast i cant remember if it was a tweet or during his own ama but rogan said he would love to have you on as a guest  rza - yes i would love to be on as a guest someday. ill wait for the time for him to invite me 23. hey rza really glad youre doing this ama. i read somewhere that you and john frusciante have recorded a ton of material. i really liked fm. any chance you two might release a full album in the future that would be awesome  rza - heres a chance for that. if life permits 24. actor in brick mansions. amaa hey hey now lets not forget the awesome performance in the man with the iron fists good job man. how much fun is it being so versatile  rza - its very challenging. because some of my friends are thinking im becoming a little schizo. wow the life of an artist 25. i was recently in a yoga class and the instructor said protect your neck and i immediately thought of wu-tang and giggled to myself. what do you think about a rap-inspired yoga class would bring a whole new meaning to flow.  rza - lol 26. many critics believe double albums usually contain filler and do not hold them as in high of regard as they could and should be. what would you say were the main reasons wu-tang forever was made into a double album instead of 2 different albums with a later release date for songs not used on first album was some of the inspiration for making it a double album taken from the success of all eyez on me or more that you wanted to get more music out  rza - actually a double-album was part creative and part business. if i can recall we hadnt done an album as wu-tang clan for four years. and so we wanted to give steve rifkin an abundant amount of material. but also we demanded a budget so high that to appease it they said how about a double album 27. prince rakeem just wanted to give you a shout out for saving my life or at least my wallet way back when 12 years ago im serving a mormon mission in brazil. im assigned to a poverty stricken area of curitiba a city of about 2 million people. im 20 years old young enough to think im invincible and stupid enough to not heed the advice to stay out of this particular neighborhood. this is one of those favelas that you hear about in the news. houses made of plywood cardboard and tarp; a river of feces trash and decaying dog carcasses; red dirt roads that turn into streams during rainstorms and a whole lot of people walking around that didnt really have anything to do other than observe those who didnt belong. this is the same place where you read about nightly murders in the newspaper. the problem was this neighborhood was right in the middle of our area and it made it difficult to get from one side to the other without passing through. although my mission companion and i had been through the neighborhood a handful of times during the day we had never ventured to pass through at night well this night a meeting of ours goes particularly late at night and we are dead tired after a long day. from where we were we were going to have to walk around the outside of the favela to get home and that was about an hour-long walk. instead we decide to cut through the favela to cut it down to about 20 minutes. at first the decision seems like the right one. the moonlight is blanketing the road the night is freezing but still and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs it just isnt that bad tonight. the road we choose to walk down is the same one weve used in the past but now that its night i start to realize some things i hadnt before. the road is like a chute without any roads intersecting it. its like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends. as we walk i start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road. as we get closer the figures start to meander to the middle of the road. my companion who has only been in brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on. i casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road and i see five figures evenly spaced across the road walking toward us. i turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well. by this point even my na\u00efve little friend knows were screwed. as we approach the group i notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats baggy jeans boots hoodies winter caps. but one detail struck me immediately. all of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem i knew very well. it was the wu-tang logo. mind you i was obsessed with wu-tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group. as we stop looking the men in the face the lines of men behind and in front of us meet to form a circle around us. the man directly in front of us asks perdidos and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun. before he pulls the gun from his coat i almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing i could think to say: in portuguese i ask you guys are wu-tang fans the man pulling the gun immediately pauses. the man who first spoke asks what do you know about wu-tang i respond by telling him that im a huge fan and i know all about them. obviously they doubt everything im saying. after all im a white kid wearing a white shirt and tie with a part in my hair. at that moment i began to realize how i wouldnt believe myself either. they begin to quiz me one thing after another\u2014names nicknames alternate names rapping styles\u2014im nailing it all after about 10 minutes of wu-tang trivia theyre convinced and they ask us to come back to one of the guys house to watch the latest video. they told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew from that day on we were in with the local gang and you really dont know just how good of a thing that was edit: thank you for reading this novel and spreading the love gold-wielding friend--whoever you are edit 2: someone below asked if there was more to the story. if your eyes can take a little more reading i explained how the night ended here  rza - wow i always believed that us who follow the way of the wu have a wavelength and a culture of our own. something like a subculture within hiphop. this story helps verify that for me. wu-tang forever brother 28. will you ever release a real true solo wu sounding album just like the others did in the 90s not discrediting the bobby digital stuff i like that but a lot of wu fans felt it wasnt a true representation of the 90s rza hard body lyrics and dusty beats will that ever happen or does everything need to move forward i jst wish i had a rza album full of songs like tragedy  rza - hmm. maybe brother maybe 29. wu-tang forever how much have comic books influenced you i still smile every time i hear you name drop rom the space knight on impossible  rza - from the age of 9-16 i probably collected thousands of comics. but they all got stolen one day along with my vinyl collection. and im telling you i used to spend my paper route money on this stuff. im still a comic fan. every once in a while if im in a certain city and they have a comic book store i will go and pick up a few copies. i love how the new artists are doing the new covers grant morrisons take on classic heroes has always been cool to me and i actually bought every copy of reginald hudlins new take on the black panther 30. whattup rza huge wu fan and personally you are my favourite producer everthank you for doing this i have a few questions actually my first question regards the tracks method man and clan in da front did you tailor a beat for every member in the clan how did you choose who got their solo songs on the albumwho are your other favourite rapper-producerslastly are there any beats that once you had finished then played back you realised that it was going to be a classic.once again thank you  rza - yes i used to tailor the beats to their rhyme styles. i knew my wu brothers for so long and made so many tapes with them that i grew an ear to what would fit the mc choosing solo songs for each artist on a wu-tang album is something that kind of materializes during the process pete rock dr. dre kanye west yes i have one right now that i just cant wait til the wu mcs get on because i just know that this is one of those magical ones 31. which rappers are you listening to the most outside of your wu-tang crew  rza - nowadays ive just become a fan of the culture of hiphop. somedays i find myself sitting on my downtime watching yo mtv raps or scrolling through youtube finding up and coming mcs. i love watching url and all the rap battles. sometimes when youre making the music you become so engulfed in yourself that you forget that you started yourself as a fan of the music. now that i get time to do other things such as act score and direct i can actually become a fan of hiphop again 32. what is your relationship with bill murray like you guys were in coffee and cigarettes in 2003 and then in 2010 this happened. do you still talk  rza - i dont talk to him often because we both have crazy-busy schedules but we have a similar circle of friends. what i can say is what a cool dude 33. whats good rza. first shoutout to /r/hiphopheads. how do you stay creative as you do lyrically and production wise  rza - i use life as inspiration. and being that i travel a lot and see a lot of different things and meet a lot of great people i stay inspired. shoutout to /r/hiphopheads 34. could you elaborate on your infamous flood story the legend says that you once had a flood into your basement that caused you to lose a few hundred beats you had made that were meant to be put onto the first round of wu-tang solo albums did this actually happen did you recreate any of the beats that you lost if so which ones  rza - yeah i lost a lot of beats. in those days i would keep my beats in a floppy disk holder which held 80 disks per case. and i had the cases sectioned out with names of each wu member and beats that fit their styles. those disks have not been recovered yet. i have some of them but they wont play 35. hey rza huge fan here ive been listening to you since i was 10. one question are you not going to publically publish songs off the new wutang albulm or will it only be avaliable to the one lucky buyer  rza - the album thats entitled a better tomorrow if completed will be available to the public. the album entitled once upon a time in shaolin is a piece of art that only one will be made 36. when was the last time you saw paul walker  rza - the last time i saw paul in the flesh was on the movie set. we had planned on seeing each other again at the premiere. but destiny bends 37. how awesome is it being a robert mine name is robert  rza - super duper awesome 38. how did you come up with the name rza  rza - in my neighborhood my homies would call me the rza rza ra. because they said i was razor-sharp. ra was my chosen name short for rakeem. when i decided to improve myself i changed my name to rakeem zig-zag-zig-allah. and rza is like an acronym for that 39. whats your favourite videogame  rza - nowadays well its hard to say your favorite video game but one game ive been buying for years and continue to buy every version they make is tekken. actually when wu-tang first started making money me and method man came to manhattan and went to the place where they sell real pinball machines and video games and we tried to buy a tekken to bring home to our house. and they wouldnt sell it to us at that time. method man would up getting one though. i wound up getting a pinball machine. anyway tekken 40. you get a swimming pool but you cant fill it with water what do you fill it with money is not a choice either  rza - those little plastic balls that you see in ball pits 41. liquid swords ii when btw liquid swords is the greatest hip-hop album of all time  rza - i think gza may be in the process of writing that now   "]}
