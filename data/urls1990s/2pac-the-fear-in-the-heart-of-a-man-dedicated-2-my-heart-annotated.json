{"az ": ["  against an attacker i will boldly take my stand because my heart will show fear 4 no man but 4 a broken heart i run with fright scared 2 be blind in a vulnerable night i believe this fear is in every man some will acknowledge it others will fail 2 understand there is no fear in a shallow heart because shallow hearts dont fall apart but feeling hearts that truly care are fragile 2 the flow of air and if i am 2 be true then i must give my fragile heart i may receive great joy or u may return it ripped apart  "]}
