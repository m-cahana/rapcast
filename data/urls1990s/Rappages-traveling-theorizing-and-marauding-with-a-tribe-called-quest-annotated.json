{"": [" tell me how you like to work. ", " we like to develop the beats at home and then lay the tracks in the studio.  ", " what type of setup do you have at the crib ", " sp1200 mackie four-track two 1200 technics turntables gli mixer a yamaha speaker thats about 80 watts with an eight-inch woofer built in the amp. its just a little small setup for my room in my crib. i also have an akai four-track and i like it because of the eqs set. they have the indentures in it and its easy to maneuver. i have an atari 1040 computer and ali likes working with the mac. the mac is compatible and i work with both. the language on the atari is a little easier.  ", " so when you go to the studio do you bring your own equipment or do you rent ", " sometimes we rent and sometimes we bring our own shit. it depends on if you have the proper casing so the equipment wont get messed up. id rather bring it cause you save money.

", " eventually we started to get more and more stuff. ", " eventually i want my own studio. my dream board is the sony gml. ali likes the ssls but i cant mess with them. ssls are cool because they are process. i like mixing on them but id rather cut on a neve board. on a neve you have more bottom out. its a warmer sound and its chunky. then with an ssl you can come clean everything up. so i like to mess it up first then clean it up with the ssl.

", " i heard that a lot people was at that record show at the roosevelt hotel in new york city. what was that all about ", " everybody right now is on this whole beat stupor. ive been getting beats since high school. me my man juju from the beatnuts. afrika ", " have yall started a production company yet ", "", "  as hip-hop grows older it is interesting to see which artists are able to maintain musical longevity. in this age many acts fight so hard to retain their musical integrity and originality that they sometimes suffer from self-indulgence. these artists get so wrapped up in themselves that they ultimately lose their listeners. the ongoing musical struggle is to maintain the balance between unique artistry and universal fatness.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a tribe called quest represents a group of young musicians who know how to give the people what they want. tribe has always been at the forefront of the musical progression in hip-hop with their unique use of jazz samples and live instrumentation. we all must remember that tip and ali were two of the key producers responsible for that whole rim shot high hat kick drum flavor tom scott that every producer in hip-hop has imitated to the point of making it redundant.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tribes consistency has to do with their ability to find the perfect verbal cadence in their lyrical delivery and freely mix that up with their sophisticated musical arrangements. as a result their range and scope has proven to be very broad with the group producing everyone from run-dmc to nas to tiger to tony toni tone. tribe also exemplify the essence of being contemporary electronic musicians by transferring the same determination and work ethic that gave them the skills to use sp1200 sampling machines to teaching themselves how to play the bass guitar keyboards and the trap drum set.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tribes seriousness and focus is very refreshing and these qualities easily explain their growth and success. its clear to me why a tribe called quest stays on top of their game and continue to be at the head of their class.   yes we have a production deal with eastwest records called museum music. we have one artist vinia moheta.
