{"rza": ["  this song entitled destiny bends was written last night after hearing the tragic news of the loss of a good man named paul walker. i met paul on the set of the film brick mansion where we talked laughed and exchanged ideas of life and fatherhood. i only knew him personally for less than a year but we knew each other through our work and art. we saw in each other a kindred spirit of men coming from unlikely circumstances and rising to be the light and beacon of our family and loved ones. men who learned the joy and pains of love in life and success while coming to realize that nothing is more important than family friendship and the brotherhood of humanity. millions of people get to know an artist or movie star through their work but few are allowed to cross each others paths and see through the veil of stardom and find the common denominator that we share. as all physical things will decay and wither away film art and music remain longer than the vessel that delivered them. in this vein the one thing we cant take away or give back is time. so thus time is the most precious gift. i dedicated my time to compose this song with my two sons and new friend will wells who was kind enough to sing and perform it for me. we dedicate it to paul walker. a good man. we had plans to continue working with each other in the future. it seemed destined but destiny bends.  *note* this song is not for criticism its just a sketch demo. please enjoy and reflect.  your comrade in the struggle rza  "]}
