{"gang starr": ["  im just another voice from the street and since its my choice i feel that i must speak now i know that you wont listen to little me but i cant rest unless i get this off my chest see the citys my home the streets where i roam but still i leave the drugs and violence alone and so i try to stay in the right frame of mind although i know some people who might say that im crazy and lazy for not breakin out but the city has soul and thats what im about i have an appetite that must be fed no longer blind and being led the kind of freedom that you can buy my bank wont lend me yet but still i can get by--and even smile so dont judge me by the colour of my skin my blood runs as deep as your runs red so you can see it aint over yet which takes me out of the rap  the choice is mine with my joy and pain inside i try to get by and i aint gone under yet  see bodies with souls living in the street no one wants to live with nothing to eat but to climb over living people and feel that they brought in on themselves cause they lazy or would rather steal is a mystery-- so dont judge me by the colour of my skin my blood runs as deep as your runs red so you can see it aint over yet which takes me out of the verse  your under is my over ive never seen your over yet but dont forget: i aint gone under yet  i dont steal i dont run tricks or scams cause im a strong young woman yes i know who i am but sometimes its so hard to get by and touch circumstances make me want to get high but i dont go too far cause that aint my style so why dont you come live next to me for a while  "]}
