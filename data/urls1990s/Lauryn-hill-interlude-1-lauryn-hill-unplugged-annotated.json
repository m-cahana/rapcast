{"lauryn hill": ["  ill tell you um... every single one of these songs um is about me first. me first um it was like you know there was a period of time where i was just out you know just just gone from the public and uh i came to terms with the fact that... i had created this uh public persona this public illusion.  and it became it uh it helped me hostage; like i couldnt be a real person because youre too afraid of you know what your your public will say.  and at that point i had to do some dying and really accept the fact that look this is who i am and i have to be who i am and all of us have a right to be who we are and whenever we submit our will because our will is a gift it is given to us so whenever we submit our will to someone elses opinion you know i mean a part of us dies.  you know and so its been um... its been it actually hasnt been a long time. it feels like a long time but it hasnt been a long time. some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time and uh im just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things ive learned.  i know some of it sounds almost cryptic and i been really just just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where im coming from as simply as possible so im working on that.  but um... you know i know that you know that theres uh... you know that i know that god doesnt lie and i know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else so i dont worry about that cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening thats what supposed to be understood at that time so its all good.  but um this is a song called oh jerusalem.
