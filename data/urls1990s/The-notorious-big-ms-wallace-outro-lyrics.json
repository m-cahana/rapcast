{"the notorious b.i.g.": ["  hi im voletta wallace biggies mom i wish to thank you for your kind words you warm gestures and your constant support over the years i also need to share with you a few words about my son please take a few moments and listen i hope you gain something from it thanks  as a child christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet and of course he was mischievous as all little boys are as a young man he liked to do everything  he liked to read he liked to be with his friends as young kids or young boys he enjoyed life everything that would make him happy or comfortable he would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family  his early inspirations toward rap music were the lls of the world the sugar hills the mr. magics and the fat boys of the rap channel those were all the things i heard in the house  even though i called it noise and banging i know now it is a accepted musical art form i was a single parent i raised my son on my own his father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet or career he chose  my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my sons life he developed paranoia about death and about the dying  we are living in a world of imperfect human beings where greed jealousy and envy are manifested by what others have accomplished in life my son was very very much aware of that  he appreciated his station in life on the directions in which he was going or traveling on the other hand there were others who i should use the hip hop phrase player hating  and i think that is what resulted in his paranoia if i had to change anything in my sons life that would have allowed him to be here today i would have deterred him from a career in music  im aware that millions appreciate his music millions loved his music be that it may if he hadnt chosen that lifestyle that career my son would be alive today if i could sum up christopher in one word the word would be generous  the thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that he was in a position to help position to share position to give to others who needed to others who wanted to others appreciated the gifts that he gave  "]}
