{"az ": ["  in the midst of passion 2 figures stand emerged in ecstasy joined hand and hand words r unnecessary feelings r heart the body takes control deaf 2 words it is at this stage that i think of u in gratitude 4 this joy u have exposed me 2 each day is bright with you as the dawn with the collapse of each night a strong bond is born in the midst of passion i remember your kiss i reminisce about your touch and suddenly miss the scent u wear and the tone of your voice only u can be my choice in the midst of passion i c u & me lost in constant ecstasy  "]}
