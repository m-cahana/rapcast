{"the roots": ["", "   peaceful minds.. in a land of war seek peace of mind through mental peacefulness peacefulness peacefulness peace-ful-ness is in the mind of the beholder behold my mental piece could shatter your peace to pieces pieces and portions of rhythmic distortion relax me the echos reverb and feedback of reality disturb my peace forcing me to retreat to the below beneath down a step and a step and a step and a step and a step beyond to a level of my own private mystic ritualistic culturalistic sanity yet some say that i am insane is that not ironic my soul not sonic as i flow through the tonic of life i find that the strife behind that pushes and pulls and pulls and pushes me into all of the bullshit that i experience from day to day is the reason.. for my search or journey or struggle to find.. the broken pieces of the sign that combine to form the crooked line that we call.. peace yall  "]}
