{"young mc": ["  now this rhyme right here has been dedicated to all rap fans that said that they hated the other mcs whose rhymes deviated cause this is real gold its not gold plated a few years ago these rhymes were created i was real proud and very elated it took a long time as i calculated but now i look back im glad i waited at so many times i was so frustrated cause i couldnt finish up what i initiated i got mad and quite agitated and i remember rhymes that i had confiscated but one day this girl she perpetrated she was cute and quite educated we got married at once and it was consummated but once it hit the books it was ill-fated she took me to court to have it litigated a judge and a jury thats how it operated the jury went away and they deliberated then she took all of my money had my house renovated i felt so poor and so humiliated because of a fight that i instigated but i got my money back and i was jubilated cause the first court decision was never validated for weeks and weeks i just celebrated because the jury and judge recapitulated and all of my funds were never liquidated yes i won yes i dominated i saw another girl and my heart pulsated she just looked like that girl i made it wouldve have been part two of this rhyme that ive stated so ill just go home and read my sports illustrated  "]}
