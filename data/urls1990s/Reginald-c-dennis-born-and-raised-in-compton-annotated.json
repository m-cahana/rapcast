{"": [" your success has been rather sudden did you expect all of this ", " naw man i mean this is some shit i didnt think it would go as far as posters. i just thought it would be the record album some posters and maybe people would like it. i did not think i would sell 25000 records a day.  how long have you been involved in rap believe it or not im kind of new at it but im no newjack. ive been a dj since 81 but ive only been actively rappin since 89. but in that short time ive learned and acquired so much. in terms of rap some of my biggest influences have been most of the east coast rappers and groups like pe and run-dmc have definitely looked out for me. they know what time it is but a lot of other new yorkers dont. theyve been sleeping on me.  how does that make you feel it doesnt matter. if my record was to stop sellin right now\u2014i hope to god it dont\u2014at least ive proved something. im here for the betterment of rap. i write everything. i play everything except bass and guitar. i produce everything. its all conceived arranged and produced by myself. i even do a little engineering. im definitely a one man band all those others are perpin.  what would you say is the factor that makes you able to handle all of those chores because ive been doing it for so long. when all of my hard-headed friends was out fuckin up gangbangin and doin all that bullshit i was in the house learning how to work a four track; learning how to ping-pong; learning about equipment that muhfukahs wouldnt have the patience to pick up a manual to read about. im the type of person that when i buy a new piece of equipment before i start messin with it ill read the whole manual and get to know the equipment before i even get it out of the box. thats the kind of person i am real thorough.  what makes you different from other compton rappers well if youve heard most of the successful rap out of compton youll see that its gangsta influenced. im not totally negative im on more of the lets have fun lets kick it type of vibe than my predecessors nwa and ice cube\u2014who i might add aint really from compton hype\u2026 wake up\u2014and i feel that im slightly a breed apart. i think that im genuinely talented and not just a sample loop artist. i have a lot of influences in my work from hiroshima to jim morrison. there are a lot of jazz and r&b overtones in my music even a little reggae. its all evolution just like there were people before me there will be people after me. this is my contribution to music.  are you thinking of a long term career in music yes i dont want to rap forever. i dont really want to go as far as the third or the fourth album. i see myself as playing the backfield in the future producing other acts. its simple to write a rhyme with a catchy hook and have it formatted correctly but i dont really see myself doing this forever. i consider myself to be a producer first and a rapper second.  as a producer who will you be working with in the future one of my homeboys that i co-produce is hittin hard right now\u2014amg on select\u2014and its called bitch betta have my money. and my boys second to none will be comin out on profile at the end of the summer and if i must say production wise its way different than what ive done before in the past. theres not a lot of samples. i used real musical arrangements strings keyboard piano. the musicality has a real twist to it. i want to get away from sampling and get into more live instruments and creating original music.  so you dont want to become one of those guys where as soon as you put the record on you know who produced it and everyones record sounds the same nah im not goin out like that. im always changing my sound. like when i do my new songs now i try to never use the same break beats. i damn near hardly ever use breakbeats anyway not like substitution and funky drummer\u2026 because its so played. sorry. and out in la it seems like you cant be a producer without 25 volumes of ultimate breaks and beats. not to dis classic beats but theres a lot of stuff out there that hasnt been used yet. old breakbeats have their place but im not gonna use them as much.  what about your lyrics my lyrics will show a real diversity on the next album. i mean im about more than just pussy dick 8-ball suck this lick that tramp ho etc. its no like that all of the time. i can get just as deep lyrically as anyone else right now but i didnt for this album because i knew that the simplicity would sell. dont get me wrong im with the third eye im with the islamic thing but people dont want to be taught all day. theres a time when people are like yo lets just kick it\u2026 its friday night lets party and i think that some of my music compliments that mood. but on my next album you will hear a lot of different stuff. i definitely have a whole lot of new influences and inspirations that i cant wait to get back into the studio to act upon.  "], "dj quik": ["  although you say you are not a gangsta there has been a lot of controversy following you the past few months. would you like to address that there are a lot of rumors in my hometown about me being a notorious blood and gang bangin and im not going to let a bunch of gang bangers ruin what ive built up and accomplished ive got crips crossing out my face at the wherehouse and puttin up crip neighborhoods and shit. i grew up in a blood neighborhood but i was never down with red rags red shoes never even had a pair of red shoestrings none of that shit. but because thats the neighborhood im from i get sweated for it.  ive even heard that people have supposedly found gang meanings in your cover artwork. yeah ttp is the initials of a gang in compton called the tree top pyroues and coincidentally my production company ", " had the same logo ttp. but people made those connections themselves i had nothing to do with it. and the way i spell my name\u2014quik without the c\u2014was taken by some to be anti-crip and it aint even like that. theyre just tryin to clown.  how does something like this get started well most of them knew that i was from tree top ", "", "  i want to see the bronx exclaimed dj quik as we lounged in the luxurious splendor of the conference room at profile records manhattan office. a serious student of rap quik would rather see the birthplace of hip-hop than remain cooped up in an office answering questions on this lovely spring day but it couldnt be helped; such is the heavy price of success. hailing from compton california\u2014a city nearly equal to the bronx in terms of rap success and innovation\u2014quik is not afraid to give credit where it is due. although he sports gheri curls and wears the typical black uniform of the c.p.t. dj quik is not your typical gangsta mc. with his platinum bound debut quik is the name selling over 25000 units a day quik is putting compton on the map all over again. to use his own words dj quik is definitely a force to be reckoned with.   but i wasnt a gangbanger. i mean all of the bloods didnt give eazy-e that flack; they didnt sweat him they bought his shit and was like cool so what hes a crip. then i come out and get sweated and im nowhere near a gangbanger.  what about the situation at the san francisco concert last march the police went to a hard-headed 16 year old kid to find out what really happened on the inside. he gave them a way out rendition of what happened and it wasnt even true. he said that we got up on stage and made a reference to the compton crips\u2014im not even halfway a crip\u2014threw up a c or said cuz or whatever and the stage got rushed by niggas yellin filmore and h.p. and that was totally garbage. the truth of the matter is and there are plenty of witnesses is that we had very weak security and when i finally made my entrance the whole muhfukin left side of the stage caved in with girls screamin kissin and grabbin all over me. i couldnt even perform my show. before i knew it security grabbed me and i got rushed out of the building out the back to my limo and was still being chased by women\u2014not by niggas yellin h.p. and filmore not by police not by no flyin chairs but strictly women\u2014and thats the truth  its almost as if the media would rather cover a negative event and if there isnt one they make it up\u2026 of course its their job to hype all of the garbage. you get turnouts where there are much more people around than needed to start a riot and nothing happens but they dont print that. there is a plot to destroy real street hardcore rap\u2014the original stuff. not the hammers because they love their hammer and their commercial muhfukin vanilla ice; thats their pets\u2026their puppets. but they will try to crush anyone who goes against what they think is right.  how did that incident affect you the saddest part about it is that it wasnt even true. i wish there was a way to sue them for that muhfukin lyin. now ive got a rep and it will be hard to book shows. if this stuff continues there wont be anymore live shows. theyre hurtin it for the people that we influence the people that will look at what weve done grab the baton and take the music to the next level.
