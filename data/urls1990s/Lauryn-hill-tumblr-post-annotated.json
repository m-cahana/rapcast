{"lauryn hill": ["  it has been reported that i signed a new record deal and that i did this to pay taxes. yes i have recently entered into an agreement with sony worldwide entertainment to launch a new label on which my new music will be released. and yes i am working on new music.  ive remained silent after an extensive healing process. this has been a 10+ year battle for a long time played out behind closed doors but now in front of the public eye. this is an old conflict between art and commerce\u2026 free minds and minds that are perhaps overly tethered to structure. this is about inequity and the resulting disenfranchisement caused by it. ive been fighting for existential and economic freedom which means the freedom to create and live without someone threatening controlling and/or manipulating the art and the artist by tying the purse strings.  it took years for me to get out of the parasitic dynamic of my youth and into a deal that better reflects my true contribution as an artist and purportedly gives me the control necessary to create a paradigm suitable for my needs. i have been working towards this for a long time not just because of my current legal situation but because i am an artist i love to create and i need the proper platform to do so.  the nature of my new business venture as well as the dollar amount reported was inaccurate only a portion of the overall deal. keep in mind my past recordings have sold over 50000000 units worldwide earning the label a tremendous amount of money a fraction of which actually came to me.  only a completely complicated set of traps manipulations and inequitable business arrangements could put someone who has accomplished the things that i have financially in need of anything. i am one artist who finds value in openly discussing the dynamics within this industry that force artists to compromise or distort themselves and what they do rather than allowing them to make the music that people need. there are volumes that could and will be said.  mlh  "]}
