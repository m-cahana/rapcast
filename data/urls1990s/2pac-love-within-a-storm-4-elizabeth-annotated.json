{"az ": ["  we made love within a storm in the midst of passion and chaos somewhere somehow our true bond of friendship was lost  in the eye of the storm the rain always falls harder those who prevail this trauma will learn 2 bring their love farther  but now the storm has passed and the seas of our friendship r calm but as long as i live i will remember the love within the storm  "]}
