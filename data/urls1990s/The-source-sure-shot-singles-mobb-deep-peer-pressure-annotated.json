{"mobb deep": ["  peer pressure b/w flavor for the non believers  4th & bway production: dj premier paul shabazz  you will remember 92 as the year when the shorties rocked the mic. but none of em ever got as raw as these kids. though havock and prodigy look young they are far from being bubble gum pop sensations. on peer pressure mobb deep kicks the real about how hard it is to grow up positive and legal when all you are surrounded by is negative. i used to dream of being an architect/ believe me its easier said than done because its hard to get/ out of the projects without forgettin where you come from.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on the b-side they put the social commentary on hold and get buck wild on the mic. flavor features some of the best freestyles of the year as well as an incredible neck-snappin acoustic bassline. prodigy sounds like hes been making records for ten years when he kicks it like: mr. soul/trunk jewels sippin old gold/roll up my nickel bag of weed/lick it up and stroll. definitely not for the playgrounds.
