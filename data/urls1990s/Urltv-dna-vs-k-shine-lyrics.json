nigga that by me and i bit him back well talk about how it was 20 niggas there and i didnt run niggai stood and scrapped so if you wanna talk about something nigga lets talk about facts cause you dont run when you fight either so i doubt youll run when its a shootout nah im being for real yall cause we all letting the truth out cause he stood right there on the floor when t-bo knocked yo fucking tooth out what he think im a do if he try me im taking the whole new route that s brain particles all over his shoulders his arms and his legs laid next to a stroller guts on a love seat right next to the sofa his face dead smack on the.... oh my god they gon think a promoter let them weapons here whys that cause all you see is dna dna dna dna dna nigga im putting dna everywhere im in shape like rocky when he boxed with apollo if he dies he dies i got the conscience of drago head shot life support if he try to survive though i creep through the hospital and pull the cord on him i give him that macho camacho when you battled eurgh er i see c erics confused cause you not a shooter i see c eric talk tools but if its er i see c that erics a fool have you and a doctor i see c eric in 2s in an e.r. i see c when i split eric in 2 thats round 2 its getting hot in here yall know that niggas slogan get em the fuck outta here no get his hat the fuck outta here get his tracks the fuck outta here get them weak ass boring ass raps the fuck outta here you got that tooth fixed nigga get that cap the fuck outta here that dirty hoodie that you wear to every fucking battle get that the fuck outta here zip em up  ", " you make the worst life decisions for instance why the fuck do you throw up every time you in front of a good crowd why do all of your close battles turn into 8 mile your palms be sweaty knees weeks arms be heavy vomit on that sweater already charlies spaghetti hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs but it get osama deadly so when you say you a killa i believe it cause you show the world that you are a hit man another nigga calling earl you make the worst life... nah fuck all that reading them tweets and them blogs became extremely upsetting yall saying with dnas intellect and k-shine aggression it can go ether direction now either that was an insult to my intelligence or yalldont know the difference between a beast and a peasant but being that we using dna its only right i take a scientific method and teach yall a lesson give me a second... now yall probably wondering why l bring all this to the center stage cause if yall dont understand a human body all you gotta do is breakdown dna you aint got a tough joint connected to your fucking bones you lost to x that s why i see bitch when the chrome is on chromosome a sperm cell from charlie but if hes the heart that mean that blood that pump through your veins aint thick enough to hold its own so every time you spit they bring organs center stage if yall wanna understand a human body all you gotta do is breakdown dna wait now lets go these bars so yall could feel this if yall aint familiar with this this a double helix its the same setup that this nigga use with his lyrics but im a show you how to take this dna with this dna and compare it you use one solid bar and try to make it a setup than use words that coincide to make it look better than and it with a wavy line so yall think that he clever but i dont know how he fucking yall head up when ds just like the setup a double helix two wavy lines with little bars in between that keep em together if yall wanna know why i brung all this to the center stage if yall dont understand a human body all you gotta do h breakdown dna now everyones familiar with a cell is right we all know the human body was processed from this cell sperm cell which gave us life right which is also dna but i dont think thats bright cause ironically dna has never been in a cell in his life have you ever seen a cell have you ever made a sale have you ever been in a cell no thats what lead us back to this chart cause these are blood cells they travel through your veins to give that little shit in your chest a spark if you lack these that mean you never had a beat from the start so a cell is not an option all your beats are for bars cause dna can never live in a cell if you aint got no heart nigga if yall wanna know why i brung all this to the center stage if yall dont understand a human body all you gotta do is breakdown dna now an atom is the reason why a human energy is possible two more atoms together creates a molecule all your energy comes from a nigga holding you down so your energys on top of you lets see where all your energy goes when them real clips is inside of you so if yall wanna know why i brought all this to the center stage if yall dont understand a human body all you gotta do is breakdown dna no before i leave this segment im a leave a grade on how a human gets body bodied its only right we give d and n a now yall see why l grabbed this shit alright now class dismissed now look what fab say i wipe all my tears before i put on my gloves cause it hurt when you gotta kill a nigga you love well i want you to know how i feel since im in that position i feel like nino brown nigga minus all of the snitching g money we couldve been getting lump sums of bread you let one of yo bitches that im dicking fuck with yo head now instead of getting work you getting worked getting fucked up instead you mean to tell me that measley bitch creeping is the reason our whole operation dead instead of expressing your feelings you give your dawgs up to the feds thats why when you say am i my brothers keeper i look you square in your eyes nigga and say yes i am and give you one to the head and clips you condone this shit we was supposed to be like brothers we made this carter look good we was holding down each other you let another nigga infiltrate he end up being undercover now everybody going down this shit bigger than nino brown and conceited i never liked you anyway pretty motherfucker that chopper like a psychic it be getting my palms read you caught that that chopper like a psychic it be getting my palms red i send that nigga right to the light if con ed i got a long clip that be hanging like ", "  [] itll be like eric said a line  conceited didnt get the bar said i have dna going right over con head zip em up  [round 3: dna] now in that last round you tried to breakdown my body and i admit you let your heater spray too but how can you compare a whole round to something when you about human too and you got dna too so i cant even dap him up or give him props or respect him cause how we know you got body parts but i wont speak about cause niggas already touched your rectum now round 1 i told yall the definition of shine was a quality of brightness that reflects light this round im a indicate every way possible why him choosing that name just aint bright for instance when you battled john john you spit a whole round about him biting people like you aint have a fight outside with joe light and was biting people he said you wanna battle me shine you said no he said who you getting loud with shine you said yo after that you aint look like iron mike you showed your true colors when it was time to fight cause even though you got ultra violent violet we all saw the outcome between shine and light now how the fuck is shine bright when this stupid nigga got rhymes like you told passwurdz that 2pac was only known for being well paid but the only thing that he was really known for was for being born and dying in la first off 2pac died in vegas thats your number one problem nigga and 2: he was born in your borough thats howl know you not a harlem nigga so how the fuck is shine bright when this stupid nigga got rhymes like you told john john its bets off if you think that don king now that was cool but before that you said a odd thing cause you told john john you let your palm spring exactly how do you let your palm spring i guess that means you can winter a neck or summer a lead i find that odd yall but since you using seasons when i shoot make your arm fall now the fuck is shin... you know what lets get into some different stuff at summer madness 2 we witnessed 2000 people see another nigga grip your butt after that you was fuckin with trannies on being straight we started giving up and on top of that your man slogan is zip em up now either im buggin or mothafuckas is trippin but now you got me curious to know what the fuck you zipping you just another 5 foot nigga with a death wish sawed off shotty but shit aint shooting out bread sticks i break every bone in your foot you try to give me that easy dead kick so that when you slide up like a dancer well all see your leg twitch first dot mob was lookin shaky now zip em up lookin desperate where the fuck you find your soldiers at shine look like you got [] off craigslist i catch yall while yall at a party load up let my tec spit and give a dip to everybody thats on line nigga im netflix and when i shoot you better hope that them shells miss you but how you a blood but dont rep it let me 2-12 with you in the streets you dont got a ratchet you dont hold niggas guns when its beef you dont fight we never seen you fold niggas once in jail you used to wash niggas socks and owe niggas funds so it makes sense why you blood cause out of 32 niggas you owe 31 0-31 now im loading up in jersey with an old dirty gun and since red blood too i give 0 31 than after that i clip his dreads bullets ricocheted off his ear than hit his head now yall probably wondering why im mixing shine and 0 together not cause them niggas dead im just showing yall after i kill a dot i got it in for red infared and if roc owe me a rock thatll get you killed so you better have my cake doe cause once i start shootin all you niggas better lay low you gon see if i see this cat fishing im a let my 8 go so just think notre dame cause im a get this man tied if tay owe plus l feel like lebron cause im good with the heat my credibility perfect everywhere nigga im good in these streets third round im cookin him nigga shine looking deceased but don demarco i feel like freeway so put on a beat round 3 yeah its getting hot in here yall know my slogan get em the fuck outta here round 3 yeah its getting hot in here yall know my slogan get em the fuck outta here first i murder roc just got rid of tay tay kill em in the morning im a show you how to break day no scope no chopper you dont even need an ak just a big ass streetsweeper to get k kay slayed slay fuck it now l see im who you idolize deaths been set and your funerals been finalized fam gon get em a wake with this iron 9 now your people mourning morning see your soul rising shine rise and shine so nigga rise and shine im in my best day never could you see me in the swing im in my best place scope 4-5 and the 9 with the best aim rip to big cause he dying on his death date ready for mine steady with 9s heavy with rhymes gave him a warning now he ready to die great with respect signing them checks that 9 and that who shot ya now you seeing life after death and im a roc a fella and hell nah i aint with roc-a-fella he gon rock now but im gon rock forever i give this nigga some hot shit like dr. pepper and i just killed him on beat and acappella  "], "dna": [" i said the definition of shine: a quality of brightness that reflects light its funny your name shine but in this battle im a show you choosing that just aint bright for instance why recruit more dots when you got a gang right here you already in other niggas shadow so that decision aint quite clear i mean real deal and tay roc support you he im guessing they might care but how can son shine sunshine without having daylyt here you feel that thats karma lets let the lesson start you better dash or get hit with this semi thatll knock out a colon and rip your chest apart come to think of it i shouldnt even let the weapon spark when i could just hook on the dot like a question mark and speaking of questions how you did a year and a half in a max for some crack than you did three days in a half and then that fast you came back im starting to think you dont serve your full time in jail cause you scared of them killers thats reckless so im just trying to figure out how you a dot but cant finish your sentence see most niggas wanna see shine glisten and see shine glow but how the fuck we suppose to have k-shine when we already had a shyne po you battled john john and stole from john john so its no spot that this kid owns but now it makes sense why you named yourself shine cause both you niggas are big clones but see lines like that be getting to k decay like his teeth rotten but when that heat popping itll have your body over there and your brains over here like you eavesdropping see thats word play thats something you dont have and thats the problem nigga do the math we not equal in this equation im a solve it nigga you said i dont have queens shooters heh now im loading up that revolver nigga cause im a queens nigga but be on every ave like a harlem nigga now lets start on paladino cause im a leave your neck on the curb in this battle you wont win the first second or third its no need to park when i pull up in that lex in tint lexington you get your shit splattered now they all gon be mad at son when they see this fif after like malcolm youll get xd when i spray tecs and like clayton ill point at him and give him the 8 next you a saint yall dont know what a nickel is so of course you see your niggas die so once i aim at your broad way/broadway theyll find your bodies floating on riverside but i see you a loud nigga k and you like to talk a lot well this 9 millimeter here should make all the talking stop yall gon think i adopted him once i left off the glock cause im a dump bullets off in orphan this kid cause i was forced to foster pop see every punch is hard thats how they know im hot with the rhymes but its several other reasons why i got the spot over shine i battled six times last year which shows that you not on your grind so a lowercase letters the only way youll see this dot over i now after this yall all gon say my raps is hot and clearly i showed yall how to take away half the dots your man mickey keep running his mouth like i wont grab the glock and have to cap facts like a snapple top i bought the team with me racks is in 350 that 9 and the glock will put shine/shyne in a box im p. diddy its round 1 its getting hot in here and sob yall know my slogan get em the fuck outta here  ", " having a grown man fondle your ass is something you had to deal with no matter how many times you lie in your rhymes it happened and thats real shit if a nigga wouldve grabbed my ass id a smacked his hand real quick but you just scream zip em up and act like you aint feel shit you got your ass grabbed and it looked like you and your man was ready to take turns after that you shouldve moved to the lou and got you a straight perm you got your ass grabbed by your hitman ewww say word but now it makes sense cause in the dictionary shine is a verb aye verb now i know some niggas get they ass grabbed and dont be playing nothing but at summer madness 2 you got your ass grabbed and wasnt even saying nothing now you get accused of being a gay nigga by a gay nigga thats just some shit we cant mess with k but since you claim you a baller im a school him using the nba lets say your squad play tough like they all for it forward thats only gon make me bring a sub in like jamal crawford so if your man tay try to play he gon get hit with a clip about this tall and yall gon see roc get thrown in the alley like chris paul so you better have a better defender when that 8 spittin this long nose aint pippen and even if you had clips your 4 would forward jam like blake griffin so lets talk about it in another way forget the nba im a kill em with the ncaa if you and your bitch after st. john i get that scope and aim since i spot her i put bullets through her temple since i know the dame notre dame you tried to take a flight to cali cause you knew that this shit wasnt okay before you see la ucla im a make sure you and your folks lay all you gon see is people yell cause when i shoot im a be leaving no strays cause these cans is kansas for duke and everybody flying in that coach k you know what fuck it i just aim at his knee and make em kneel after i stab him with the knife you might have the knowledge to know what happened but thats only if he survive through the night if you owe me a knick i be at your door i dont gotta turn a knob all i gotta do is knock as soon as he open hell be greeted with ten knuckles and have a face full of knots knowledge knight knee kneel  knife damn im wilding today cause them last words i used show you how to silence a k now your bitch is a money whore all i gotta do is dial her up and she got me henny made a quick flip so after that she figured that i cop her copper pennies all i gave her was a nickel bag back fucked his dime and i was all up in her back and when she gave me head i aint have to tell tail cause he caught her quarter in the act now speaking of money all it takes is a couple of hundreds to replace you i mean its simple my nigga thats what money and the fame do i got blade like wesley but im coming with an 8 too cause these bullets is like jungle fever i send a couple and erase you now im a teach him the way it works cause nigga you been cursed on this earth since your date of birth if you dont want war to water break than start rolling with gorillas you get more kicks than a pregnant lady and be holding on your niggas these bullets is like a woman in labor when i unload them on a nigga cause once i start showing they all going in her liver now l just killed k-shine and his motherfucking shadow yall gon see him under dirt or some motherfucking gravel he wont be able to walk move or motherfucking travel and im a show up to your funeral in that same fucking hoodie i wear every fucking battle  "]}
