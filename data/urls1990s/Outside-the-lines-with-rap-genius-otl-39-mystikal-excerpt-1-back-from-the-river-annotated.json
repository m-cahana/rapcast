{"mystikal": ["  sameoldshawn: i was listening to back from the river the other day.  mystikal: holy shit  sos: can we talk about that on camera  mystikal: damn right we can.  sos: okay. so can you go into that -- the whole drag em n tha river/back from the river kind of thing  m: i actually started it.  sos: you started it  m: i kinda started it. unintentionally and...i didnt really give a fuck. cause at that point in my career i was battling against what we call bounce music in new orleans.  when i was first coming out i considered myself hip-hop coming from new orleans and all the new orleans audience wanted to hear was bounce.  so i was trying to compete with the fucking bounce market.  and so i had a lyric that said one never gonna change my style/two never gonna bounce never gonna bow. that was a stab at bounce music bounce artists.  i didnt give a fuck.  and unlv didnt take too well to that shit.  sos:  so they did drag em n the river.  m:  so im just riding down the street the next day and i heard oh he wants some/aint that cold.  beat knocking -- mannie fresh got that shit bumping  then i hear mystikal you a hoe.  what  hold on motherfucker  thats where that started.  and that was a real fun rivalry man  "]}
