theres reflection on the glass behind her faint speckles of light imply a city view in the distance. shoobies seated in a white swivel chair with large perforations. wide white flooring with a desk complex. neutral furniture. fluorescent lights overhead in rails\u2014glass all around. a potted plant caged with a bird. shoobie sits there in the nude anticipating a party but covers herself once she sees the car. in disbelief she walks toward steely but continues past him covering her mouth as she stares at the vehicle.  steely walks down a ramp into a living space a bar that looks off into the distance. outdoorsman photography and console portraits line a wall. a photo of steely and his dad holding a catch by the sea another of him climbing a half dome. theres a jellyfish aquarium. the seating area is an ecosystem all its own with more plants and contained living micro systems. he eats pasta and watches television. once he finishes eating he gets up undresses grabs his recall device and heads to the bathroom. steely walks into a yellow shower. a 3-d projection of a woman in blue washes his back.  dunk. break for the curb. clark taps steely on the ass blows him a kiss. clark shoves him. steely stumbles and walks over to a vehicle parked on the side. steely leans on the driver window and kisses the driver. steely circles to the other side and sits in the passenger seat. driver puts a dutch to steelys mouth. steely hits it. steely and driver kiss blowing smoke out of their noses.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0driver shoobie: relaxxx...

endorphins while his back is being rubbed by the lady in blue. he finishes his shower heads to his bed and crash into sleep. steelys blurry eyes open up to shoobie lying next to him with the look of christmas morning on her face. its 5am-ish. the glass now gives the views pass up on the level. shoobie has been dealing with gartens vehicle for the last several hours.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shoobie: the majority of gartens designs contain two access points. its a motif of his. this design in particular has nearly complete function solely from one key point. the second key point is hidden. i got its location off this things own thoughts. whatever take a seat. pointing to the car  steely takes a seat. black cup of coffee in his hand. shoobie has a rainbow coil of wires running from a handheld device into a port on the headlight of gartens car.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shoobie: wait for it. as she works  in a moment steelys vision through the windshield glows and the city past the woods falls off into sky. his entire surroundings glow golden and white and the edges of his view fall off into endless sky. he seems to be on an island floating high above any water. steely jumps a bit spills the coffee on his boxer shorts. it takes a moment for him to feel the sensation.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0steely: fuuuck....  steely jumps out of the car. pulling off his burning shorts eyes affixed to the fantastic view which is fading back into reality all around him. his vision goes back to normal again. shoobie smiles. steely starts to wring out his shorts when he gets a new message notification.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
