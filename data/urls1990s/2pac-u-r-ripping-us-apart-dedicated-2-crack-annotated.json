{"az ": ["  before u came the triangle never broke we were bonded and melded as one but as the 2 pushed u away the one got weak and embraced u and now u r ripping us apart  the worst feeling of helplessness the greatest pain has rested in my heart the vision of heaven fades and the nightmare of loneliness has started  my hero has been defeated by you and now what can i do watch as u destroy us and our love is finally through  i know the worst is here i feel it in my heart u got into the circle now youre tearing us apart   "]}
