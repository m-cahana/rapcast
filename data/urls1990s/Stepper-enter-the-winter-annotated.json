{"method man": ["  the vandal too hot to handle cause times is changed and life is strange. come to my center you enter the winter. what justifies the homicide when he dies  its always the good ones that have to die memories in the corner of my mind. something in the street went bang bang dont get mad cause it aint that bad.  for those that murdered me shall stand before god. no longer brothers were unstable like cain when he slew abel. take in my energy breathe and know the rest  cause the good die young and the hard die best.
