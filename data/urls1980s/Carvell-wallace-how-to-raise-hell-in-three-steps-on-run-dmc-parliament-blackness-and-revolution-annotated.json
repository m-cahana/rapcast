{"run-dmc": ["  1. in 1987 in a small southwestern pennsylvania steel town i was the only black kid i knew.  i was also the only kid with a copy of run-d.m.c.s raising hell. at the time those two facts seemed to be very much connected.  for those who havent had the pleasure being the only black kid in middle school is a little like having a disease that you dont want to talk about and dont want anyone else to talk about either. you feel ashamed. you feel guilty. when you get to the three or four paragraphs in your social studies book about slavery you try to look so deeply engrossed in taking notes that you dont even notice how many kids are stealing glances at you. and you dont even take notes.  you feel like black is hateful. you feel like black makes people uncomfortable and unhappy. you feel like black is your fault. because you are a kid.  so this weird thing happened with the run-d.m.c. tape. whenever i made copies of it for white kids whose parents wouldnt let them have it i always left off this one song. it was called proud to be black:  im proud to be black yall/ and thats a fact yall/ and if you try to take whats mine ill take it back yall/ its like that.  that song bothered the ever loving shit out of me. the thought of the white kids that i went to school with listening to it made me cringe. why did i have to have a song that made it ok to be who i was why did i have to be so lame and so ridiculous that run-d.m.c. needed to devote the weakest corniest track on an album full of bangers just to making me feel special the problem wasnt that i was black. the problem was that black was something so terrible that it needed a hip-hop psa just to be alright. that was some embarrassing shit for an 11-year-old. none of the white kids i knew needed that.  i didnt want to need that.  so i just ignored the song entirely.  in a seemingly unrelated story there was this one kid named jason who liked to call me a nigger. a lot. nigger this. nigger that. how many niggers does it take. did you hear about the nigger who. hey nigger. shut up nigger.  i wasnt much of a fighter. i was more of a book reader and clarinet practicer. but jason made me angry. more than angry. he made me seethe. thats the word you use when you hate something so very deeply but you feel that forces bigger than you are preventing you from doing anything about it. seethe.  one day this other kid who i wasnt even really friends with took pity on me and offered the following advice:  you oughta just fuckin punch him in the face.  really  just\u2026fuckin\u2026sucker punch him dude.  you think so  fuck yeah dude. i wouldnt let him talk to me like that if i was you.  i guess that was all i needed to hear because twenty minutes later when jason walked past me i hit him directly in the mouth as hard as i could. i wanted to draw blood. i wanted to knock him unconscious. i wanted to kill him. i wanted him to never be able to say the word nigger again.  but all that happened was i got his spit on my knuckles which were now sore. it was intense and kind of gross.  he looked at me with something i can only describe as bewilderment.  what the hell was that for  i shrugged.  you know what it was for.  he never bothered me again.  even still. i fast forwarded past that stupid run-d.m.c. song every fucking time it came on.  2.  four years later i bought my first parliament record at a store on the corner of hollywood and highland. i had since left small town america and moved to l.a. to live with my mother. it was you could say a jarring transition. hollywood was a was a different kind of place then. it was seedy and uncomfortable piss-smelling and prostitute-y. grimey. the intersection of hollywood and highland in the 90s had a deep sense of failure.  it was on this corner that i listened to the clones of dr. funkenstein for the first time. i dont know why i chose that one; it was completely random. i was afraid to ask for help. i had been told parliament was good. i grabbed the first one in the section paid for it walked out put it in my walkman and hit play.  what i heard next literally made no sense. weird sped up voices. galactic pyramids. gross sexual metaphors. nonsensical lyrics. unnecessary use of multisyllabic words. it was uncomfortably sick. ludicrous and nonsensical lyrically but surgically almost magically proficient musically. the combination was downright creepy.  standing there listening to it was kind of nice. i didnt feel like getting back on the bus to van nuys. i didnt feel like going anywhere at all. so i stayed. i didnt move from that corner until both sides had played. i bummed a cigarette. i watched cops arrest a dude who was yelling. i saw about four near auto accidents. i smelled weed. i peed in an alley between two buildings.  i had just turned 15-years-old.  something else happened that day. i realized that i really liked being an anonymous kid on a street corner in l.a. i realized that i really liked not giving a solitary fuck about what anyone was doing not even myself. i realized that in some way it was my natural state.  two days later i started dressing differently. i cut my own hair into a weird nappy mushroom top. i took this goofy trench coat i had and sliced it at the waist with a pair of scissors. on the chest i sewed the patch that i earned in a middle school spelling bee. i wrote graffiti on the sleeve in sharpie. i took to wearing pajama bottoms and black chucks. in short the combination of parliament and hollywood had instantly funked me out.  and it worked because the first time i left the house in this new uniform i experienced something that i never had before. you might call it freedom. abandon. cultural immunity. i had a self. it was adolescent and awkward and trying too hard. but it was my very own self. it was a me that was all mine. it didnt matter what anyone thought about it. for a brief moment in time i simply didnt give a fuck.  and thats an important thing. when you have come to regard your very skin color as an insufferable disease when you have to punch other people in the mouth just so you can be ok with who you are not giving a fuck is the single most divine experience you can ever have.  3.  on that very same corner twenty years later the lapd killed a man who was wielding a swiss army knife.  he was a street performer. his schtick was dressing up as the scream dude and freaking out tourists before posing with them for photos. police were responding to a report of a stabbing. they arrived saw the man and he apparently approached them. in 2014 we learned that this could mean anything. did he turn toward them when they called out did he start toward them to explain that he was a performer did he turn into a superhuman and run through fire and bullets while tearing his shirt off we dont know. all we know is that he had a swiss army knife and a group of trained officers felt that their lives were in danger. so as an lapd spokeswoman put it in the noncommittal cop speak to which weve all become woefully accustomed an officer-involved shooting occurred.  that word. occurred. like rain occurs. or wind. an officer-involved shooting is an act of nature that happens of its own volition.  the stab victim was never located.  its been a really shitty year for stuff like this.  mike browns shooting occurred tamir rices shooting occurred  eric garners death by asphyxiation occurred. jordan crawfords shooting in a wal-mart occurred. a whole lot of death at the hands of police has occurred.  black folks have realized en masse that we have to start fighting all over again. for the umpteenth fucking time. we had hoped we were done. or at least done enough to have a life that doesnt involve taking to the streets in order to be considered human. apparently we were wrong. even white people have started to wonder if maybe the racist system is unfair in a way that should actually matter to them. people have gathered in protest. thought pieces have been fired off. tweets have scored in the 10ks on favorites. comedians have been serious. riot gear has been donned. windows broken. fires set.  the victims are all still dead. the killers are still free. so what now.  as a general rule no one really wants a revolution. they are a lot of work and are tremendously inconvenient. especially in this country. we have a lot to relax over. im writing this on a comfortable chair in a decent home. you are very likely reading this on a device the market worth of which could feed a family of four for a month in some parts of the world. we have the voice and 3d-printers and websites that pick out outfits for us and mail them to our front doors. nobody wants to fight right now.  fighting is for people who dont give a fuck.  but each time an innocent person dies at the hands of police under questionable circumstances that equals one less fuck to give.  in middle school i lost a few fucks because i was alone and seething. and someone told me that i dont have to sit and take it.  on the corner of hollywood and highland i lost a few fucks because it was ugly and dirty and i was alone and the music was so disturbing so well-executed and so incredibly and viscerally powerful that it made me into someone i didnt want to be but truly was.  since then theyve cleaned that corner up real nice. put in a metro station got rid of the hookers and the pimps and opened up some national chains. that corner almost got its fucks back.  but then like an act of nature like the rain that suddenly sprang up these past few weeks to end the california drought an officer involved shooting occurred.  and another one occurred.  and another one occurred.  and another one occurred.  and with each one we lose a fuck.  with each one we turn into who we are even if we dont want to be it. and we become ready to punch directly in the mouth whoever or whatever is making us seethe.  in 1987 walk this way was the breakout single from raising hell. but its a lyric from a relatively unknown track that seems most prescient nearly 30 years later.  if you try to take whats mine ill take it back yall. its like that.  no wonder i hid that one from the white kids.
