instrumentals cut-up edits and stylistically varied backing tracks provide depth and texture.  escalating sharply from the half-baked generalizations of pes first two albums black planet unveils a powerfully focused and politicized consciousness. standing on a beat-based soapbox chuck d speaks his africentric mind on assorted cultural and political issues with typical linguistic deftness. fight the power sets the albums tone but black planets strength is the specificity of its attacks \u2013 on racism in buppie romance pollywanacraka global genetics fear of a black planet and the movies burn hollywood burn;
