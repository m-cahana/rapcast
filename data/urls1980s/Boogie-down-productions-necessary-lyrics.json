{"krs-one": ["", "   when some get together and think of rap they tend to think of violence but when they are challenged on some rock groups the result is always silence even before the rock and roll era violence played a big part in music its all according to your meaning of violence and how or in which way you use it oh no its not violent to show in movies the destruction of the human body but yes indeed its very violent to protect yourself at a party and oh no its not violent when under the christmas tree theres a look-alike gun but yes of course its violent to have an album like krs-one by all means necessary its time to end the hypocrisy what i call violence i cant do  but your kind of violence is stopping me by all means necessary the rap audience must grow up the same type of fighting we do they do except weve got nothing to blow up it doesnt matter if you win or lose its only how good you play the game this is the oldest sneak attack because it takes away our senses to gain if all i do is play the game then i am just mediocre we strive to be the best we can be not to just get over some people say that life on a whole is serious and nothing is funny but thats only if you base your life around competition and money yeah im making some money hes making some money but none of these things are necessities what i find to be a necessity is controlling a positive destiny with this money fame glory and credit will come in time the people down with me know this everyday they hear me saying rhymes i got some friends i got some allies like stet and big daddy kane they know that by all means necessary that peace is the name of this game whether peace by war or peace by peace the reality of peace is scary but we must get there one way or another by all means necessary  "]}
