{"beastie boys": ["  even for hardcore b-boys fans little was known of felicia villarreal except that she had been mike ds personal assistant and worked for the beastie boys management company.  according to 9th beastie she has steadfastly declined her spot in beastiemania\u2026  i tracked down the elusive ms. villarreal and she agreed to participate in this interview.  so get ready because this is the first time felicia has ever gone on record about her time with the boys\u2026  ben lifland: to get started can you bring us back a memory of when you first started working with the beastie boys  felicia villarreal: yeah i was thinking about this the other day.  it was right when i first started with them.  i mean we had worked together on lollapalooza but this was my first tour with the beastie boys specifically.  so there was some pressure and we were somewhere in australia or japan i dont know\u2026  we were all crammed in an elevator and i was holding all my bags and my stuff because you know\u2014a workaholic has to carry everything with her.  anyway the doors opened and i stepped\u2026  and the elevator had stopped and was halfway on the floor and halfway not on the floor.  and i fell backwards and dropped everything.  i was so embarrassed \u2014 i mean i didnt really know them yet.  until i live my last days ill never forget cane saying aiight see ya later\u2026 rookie.  and i just thought that was a perfect initiation for what was to come in truly being on the road with the entourage.  they were funny like that.  we had a great time.  everybody was family  bl: no doubt.  thats always the impression ive gotten.  that the boys go out of their way to be kind to the members of their team and i would imagine that adam yauch helped set that precedent  fv: definitely he did  bl: of course everyone who knew adam or the band will always feel that loss.  as their manager for so many years can you tell us what he meant to you  fv: for all those years i was the team leader constantly looking out for everyone.  i was always a little bit different than typical managers or label people who went out on the road.  ive had a deep love empathy and understanding for everyone ive worked with and definitely that was true with adam.  it was like being a mama bear like having all these kids who you love more than anything in the world.  you want to encourage support and protect them.  you see them as the unbelievable wonderful individuals they are.  for me that is always how i felt about adam and the boys.  after he passed away a lot of us got together in la and everybody was connecting and expressing their true emotions.  it honestly felt like i had lost a child.  because he was somebody that i loved so deeply \u2014 who i cared about so much and i always wanted to see him happy and successful.  it was really hard  bl: i hear you\u2026  like so many i felt it too.  are you still in touch with adam h. and mike  fv:  we check in occasionally.  absolutely.  i had been in touch with mike a little more frequently because he had come out to la.  he was curating an exhibit at the at the moca in downtown los angeles. it was amazing for us all to get back together.  it ended up being a moment that everyone could reconnect and it was so nice that mike was here.  when we all realized that adam had gone we were able to spend time together and talk about memories of adam reminiscing on the things we loved about him and all the times wed had together  bl: those memories must have been intense  fv: we all supported each other and we had a nice little memorial.  somebody put together a really nice video.  it was amazing because many of us were there together and we watched 15-20 years of our lives on that screen. it was truly bittersweet.  it hurt so bad to realize it would never be the same because adam wouldnt be there.  but we all felt lucky to have had all those moments together as a beastie boys family\u2026  bl: that makes sense\u2026  its nice to hear how the extended beastie family came together when everyone was hurting.  so lets rewind and talk a little bit about your decision to give up that spot as their manager.  about ten years ago you resigned from silva artist management.  a lot of our readers and the good people out there \u2014 they know so little about you.  could you explain a little bit more about why you made that decision  fv: i was always really committed to the boys and the family at silva artist management.  or when i worked on lollapalooza i knew everyone from the artists to the crew and the volunteers.  and i always saw everyone as being equal across the board.  i had that love for others and i made a lot of really amazing friends.  though i cherished those relationships they took a lot.  one day i just kind of looked up and noticed how everyone around me was having children.  i started thinking\u2026  bl: i know that feeling where all of sudden family takes precedence\u2026  where are you from originally  fv: i grew up in a small town called las cruces new mexico.  i married my high school sweetheart.  two days after my 16th birthday we had our first date.  paul and i have been married 25 years now  bl: that is amazing  fv: i know right  in the music business and still trying to balance being married  bl: so how is it that you were able to manage the beastie boys for a decade or so and yet as the fan base goes most people have been unaware of how significant your role was  fv: its kind of funny.  i recently took my kids to the california science center and theres a stealth bomber there on exhibit.  we were walking underneath it and i was laughing to myself.  my kids were like whats funny  i told them that i had my own little secret identity\u2014i used to call myself stealth.  i was always there watching out.  i knew what was going on and had to make sure everything was ok.  but like a stealth bomber nobody ever saw me.  i like to lay low.  i think its my mama bear instinct.  i was there but i wanted to stay low-key and fit in so i could really observe what was going on  bl: was there a self-preservation dynamic to that  by staying in the cut did that help prevent burnout  fv: well yes.  the work was always challenging.  as a woman and with the things that ive accomplished i have had to work so hard. my husband and i always used to say were not going to have kids.  we are going to accomplish big things and break cycles of dysfunction.  and then one day my thinking changed a little bit.  i was trying to schedule dinner with my husband on a friday night but usually i would be about three hours late\u2026  bl: haha  fv: yes paul is an incredibly patient man.  but i started feeling like i was missing something in life.  we went to the beach to talk and i said i am almost 35 and i feel like im missing out on you.  i wish we could spend more time together.  so i told paul i would give him one week to think about this\u2014because the boys are about to start another record\u2014so if you want to have kids we have a week to make that decision  bl: no pressure  fv: my husband is like what  a week went by and he didnt say anything.  i thought i must have blown his mind.  but a couple of weeks later we were finally talking about it and i thought im thirty-five; its going to take forever\u2026  then we were on a jet on our way to san francisco we were going to play bfd at shoreline amphitheatre.  i got super-sick on take off and everyone was cracking up and laughing at me because i got super nauseous and ran for the bathroom as soon as the seat belt light went off.  it was like i was on the worst flight of my life.  and i thought this is so weird its so unlike me to get so sick.  everyone was laughing at me and teasing me because they never saw me get sick.  when i got home i took a pregnancy test\u2026  bl: ah-ha  fv: the next morning we were going to irvine meadows for the kroq weenie roast.  it all happened so fast\u2014just a month later.  ill never forget because diane mix master mikes wife was sitting next to me in the car on the way to irvine.  she noticed that i looked really tired and sick today and she asked whats wrong because thats so not like you.  youre always so happy.  and i just really felt sick again and shes like oh my gosh youre pregnant.  at that point i wasnt ready to say anything  anyhow ill never forget it was one of the most heartbreaking moments of my life.  adam horovitz turned around looking at me with this sincere look of shock and sadness and hes like what  bl: for real  fv: yah adam horovitz goes you wouldnt do that me\u2026  youre not\u2026  youre going to have a baby  what  and i could see the wheels turning in his brain.  then he asks but felicia who is going to love and take care of us  it made me smile and broke my heart in the same moment.  i was so excited i just found out i was pregnant but at the same time i dont think i realized what a pivotal moment this would be in my life.  i loved these three gentlemen and my beastie boys/sam family so much.   i had no idea my life had just completely changed and i was about to begin a completely new journey. it was a big day in my life  bl: i hear you  fv: after the baby was due i was planning to go back to work with john silva you know like many people do before they know what they are getting themselves into.  and he promised me he would build this area in my office so i could have a nanny on one side and work on the other.  that way i could be with my child at work  bl: sounds perfect  fv: it felt like it would be the best of both worlds and i was so thrilled.  i thought i can do this.  but then i was working too hard and i got put on bed rest.  i had a difficult labor  bl: oh i understand  fv: then when my son jayden was three months old i was supposed to go back to work.  he hadnt changed and he hadnt made any progress at all.  my pediatrician was like thats not normal\u2026  so i talked with john.  and i told him that i was scared and that i needed to take a hiatus.  and being the person that i was a mama bear i was 100% devoted to making sure jayden was ok.  i noticed that he struggled with things where other kids didnt struggle.  and he was having a hard time and at two my pediatrician told me to go to the regional center in los angeles where they help identify children with special needs or difficulties.  at that time the regional center did a lot of evaluations.  and they told us that our son had autistic like qualities but we would have to reassess when he turned three because they do not like to label before that  bl: got it.  so were the boys supportive  fv: right about this time they had come to la to play at the greek theatre and i had gone out to see them.  this was one of the first times i had been out of the house at night since jayden was born almost 2 years earlier.  i remember talking to adam yauch and telling him about how i was struggling with missing all of them and wanting to come back but that i was also trying to figure out how to help jayden.  it still makes me cry today\u2026 adam just told me: felicia you are doing the right thing\u2026  be a mom and hes going to be ok\u2026  they are very broad with autism diagnoses and many times it really turns out to be ok.  we are all ok\u2026  be a mom.  this is an example of just how amazing adam yauch was.  when i was on bed rest so stressed because i was a workaholic and i couldnt work and paul was working with universal in florida for a couple of months\u2026 adam stopped by my house on his way to the airport and his message was very similar.  we will be ok\u2026  take care of yourself\u2026  be a mom.  adam was always the greatest dad.  i remember being on tour and always seeing him and dechen and losel at a park near whatever hotel we were at that day.  i loved that about him\u2026 bl: ok.  so what did you do to help jayden  fv: i researched everything and found all kinds of things you could do with your child\u2014occupational therapy speech therapy and floortime therapy so i was on the floor playing with him every day all day long.  it was an amazing and extremely scary time in my life.  jayden really struggled socially so during this time i hosted playgroups at my house twice per week for 7-12 kids on the spectrum and their moms and sometimes dads and therapists.  all of our children went to a school in la called smart start that used a floortime philosophy and they supported all of our children  bl: nice... you created an opportunity for mutual aid  fv: right.  it was an opportunity for these moms to feel like they had a safe place to go they werent alone and we were all here together to support one another.  also the kids were able to just be themselves without anyone judging them.  its hard when you have a child with autism or a child on the spectrum and you are at the park trying to let them be themselves and onlookers may not understand what is going on; they can be very judgemental.  kids were just themselves i always had tons of sensory things for them to get into toys that were appropriate for each of them and their favorite snacks.  there was on little girl i adored that it took a while just for her to get comfortable coming into my house\u2026 eventually we learned she loved frozen pizza so i always had a frozen pizza waiting for her.  we would make that and then have vanilla ice cream.  this is what made her happy so this is what we were going to do.  it was a great experience and i learned a lot about being a mom.  i also learned a lot about families who are dealing with this sort of diagnosis.  and i developed a lot of empathy because i understood the emotions that they were experiencing  bl: do you feel like your efforts made a difference  fv: absolutely i am a huge believer in early intervention\u2026  it can totally change a childs life.  children are so incredibly resilient.  it turns out jayden had severe developmental delays.  he really has no idea that all the fun we had when he was a kid was therapy.  he just thought we loved him played with him and we were always there for him.  we didnt feel like it was important for him to feel or know he was different in any way as a child.  no one is normal or perfect.  i am around 350 kids everyday and every single one of them are different and awesome just as we all are  bl: sounds so rewarding to be giving back to others in the same spot you had been in.  was it hard to stay away from the music business  fv: i missed it immensely.  diane mmms wife had asked me to start a dj management company with her.  so for about a year i was going through all this with my kids and i worked most nights from 9pm until about 2am.  i was helping her build this company.  after a year of doing that and waking up at 5 am in the morning with my kids who were going through a very difficult time at that point i decided i still needed to be a fulltime mom.  but when the time is right i will be back  bl: so by devoting yourself so completely to your kids you were able to make sure they stayed on the right track  fv: exactly  bl: and your son is doing better  fv: now he is doing amazingly well. he is funny smart kind and just all of the things that any parent could ever wish for.  that doesnt mean that it hasnt been a very difficult journey getting here\u2026  i really learned a lot.  when i was looking for kindergartens in la i looked at public and private schools and charter schools.  i had just about given up and i was about to start my own private school for kids of all abilities ethnicities and all income levels.  then i heard about a new charter school they were about to open in los angeles called westside innovative school house or wish charter and it was supposed to be a fully inclusive school.  meaning all kids of all abilities are taught in a class together building one community.  so i rushed over and got my lottery application in 5 days before the deadline and we got in.  i was volunteering to help hire the founding teachers and was asked to be a co-president of the parents association\u2026  but then i heard they were also looking to hire an office manager.  i had never worked in a school before and honestly hated school\u2026  but based on the new journey i was on i wanted to not only become an advocate for children and education but i wanted to be there every day\u2026  to help build the great school that i and millions of parents had dreamed of  bl: so you were able to take your skills from the music industry and apply them to this school  fv: exactly.  its funny.  people laugh at what i do because now the kids call me ms. felicia and they have no idea where i came from.  with lollapalooza and grand royal we had many kids wanting to be successful working hard to achieve their goals and they were so dedicated.  its kind of the same thing.  they all need someone to believe in them.  everyone needs someone to support them to teach them.  and at the end of the day its nice because those kids love you back  bl: gotcha.  since you brought up grand royal can you tell us about that  fv: grand royal was this amazing new label that the boys had.  it was in atwater.  it was another huge part of my life and i put a great deal of love into it.  it was one of the first independent artist labels and i got to see many amazing musicians come out of it.  there was a lot of passion and love and lots of dynamic people involved bl: i was a huge fan.  but its always been kind of a mystery to me as to why it ended up closing.  did you see the end coming  fv: the industry started changing with napster getting huge around 1999-2000.  that completely changed everything for everyone.  labels were downsizing and buying other labels.  the industry was in turmoil.  instead of embracing the new technology the industry was trying to control it or move away from it.  john silva and gary gersh started a new company called g.a.s. gersh and silva and since john managed beastie boys and gersh had been the president of capitol records im assuming it made sense to bring grand royal along for this new partnership with digital entertainment network.  it was kind of a joint kind of venture im not exactly sure but gr got folded into this digital entertainment network label.  i think there were two different philosophies at work at the new grand royal: an indie label philosophy and a big label philosophy.  digital entertainment network was a brilliant idea.  it was going to be the on-line mtv of the time.  and there were some innovative amazing people involved.  but i think the technology just wasnt quite there yet  bl: i see  fv: yeah i think in the midst of all that downsizing and splitting it just became a bad era for the music industry.  it was a shame because not only was gr a label but it felt like a family.  for anything related to the boys everyone was always so committed and it was always a big part of our lives.  it was hard when the decision came down to close gr.  the new authorities started letting everyone know on the day i was driving home to see my family in new mexico.  i was on the road and i started getting all these calls from the kids on the label scared and not sure what to do.  so after driving twelve hours to new mexico i got on the next flight headed back to la so that i could be here and make sure that everyone was ok.  one way or another we would work it out.  it was a tough time for everybody involved  bl: was there any temptation on mikes part to put up a cash infusion to try preventing grand royal from going under  fv: i think mike was very dedicated to grand royal.  he loved gr and put his heart and soul and lots of hard work into it.  and he probably did some of that\u2026  but it was just a crazy time in the world of record labels around 2000.  there were so many people losing jobs.  there was a sense of wow we have to figure out whats going on before we invest so much more in this.  we saw labels going under because people were suddenly choosing this new way of finding music online. i think we saw that it was time to take a step back and search for a new frontier or develop this into something else.  to start fresh you know  that might have been the thinking on mikes part  bl: crazy how the industry got transformed so quickly.  what about the other members of the entourage  i mean early on you had certain individuals like like ricky powell and the captain rest in peace\u2026  fv: right right  bl: ive always wondered\u2026  some of those attitudes toward women drugs and going buck wild werent exactly congruent with where the boys were going.  did that ever create tension  fv: i wasnt with them in their early years.  i met them during lollapalooza in probably 1994.  ricky was on the road with us that year. he was a lot of fun.  he was a nice guy.  the boys would just find these people in their lives like ian rogers or mix master or fredo.  we talked about this when we had yauchs memorial in la.  they would see something special in a person and they would try to support them or encourage them.  and give them opportunities to be who they wanted to be.  in time i think we all started growing up.  mike was in la and adam and adam were in new york and i think that ricky probably had other stuff going on.  everyone was starting to live grown-up lives you know  there was no real bad stuff.  you grow up with people and then they start living their own lives\u2014and youre still friends absolutely but theyre not going to take off to hit the road for 6-8 months anymore\u2026  many great people transitioned through\u2014being part of their lives for a certain period  bl: is that the way you would describe their relationship with hurricane  what can you tell us about that when they went separate ways  fv: that was something that they worked on.  hurra and the boys are still good friends i saw him at the memorial in new york.  i still see hurra on facebook all the time.  i wasnt there so i dont know exactly what those conversations entailed.  but i can tell you that they absolutely love hurra and hurra loves them.  i dont know what else to tell you except that everyone goes through transitions and ends up in a different place in their life  bl: fair enough\u2026  fv: yeah i dont know exactly how to answer that question  bl: what about mario caldato  why didnt he produce to the five boroughs  fv: again i think those were conversations that john probably had with them.  i dont know exactly.  they worked together a long time.  i think mario was doing great stuff\u2026  hes done a bunch of great records and he was out here in la but i dont know why they chose\u2026  why they made that decision.  but i can tell you that mario is still a very important person in their lives he had a huge impact on their music.  that will always be the way it is.  they still have a deep respect compassion and love for each other.  in la thats where we went for part of adams memorial\u2026 we went to marios new studio in eagle rock  bl: i understand.  tell me was it difficult trying to rein them in  i mean they had all this passion for all these different projects.  at the drop of a hat mca would be going out to utah snowboarding and then it was the tibetan freedom concerts.  was it hard getting them to focus  fv: i met them while i was working on lollapalooza and i think thats one of the qualities that drew me to them.  im always multitasking.  i loved and respected that not only were they the beastie boys but they had a record label that they were trying to run.  i loved that they created milarepa.  they used to be very involved in x-large clothes.  for me music is the way to reach out to the world and communicate and come together. i loved how they found so many different ways to channel their creativity into so many different things.  was it crazy sometimes  of course\u2026 bl: crazy how  fv: i remember when i met adam at lollapalooza.  they were headliners and adam was like im going to bring these tibetan monks on tour.  and i was like what  the monks would come and do the blessing every day and it was an amazing introduction to a different culture and other things that were happening in the world.  and i think lollapalooza was the way that our generation learned about politics and becoming themselves and that the world is a bigger place.  it was our way of growing up.  i spent so much time with the monks.  but im going to be honest.  at first they didnt particularly embrace the monks and they were a little bit disrespectful.  it was frustrating  bl: who was disrespectful toward the monks  fv: well see this was when adam was just starting with the monks.  and nobody really understood.  adam hadnt set up milarepa yet and nobody really knew about tibet.  i mean you have a bunch of 20 year-old kids that came to see rock and roll and then you have these monks on the stage chanting\u2026  bl: i see  fv: adam always inspired me\u2014the way he would bring out issues and put them in front of people.  he didnt preach.  he understood that you have to let people make their own choices.  i mean the way he blended milarepa with the tibetan freedom festivals was just beautiful.  people came for the show but he also inspired them to take notice of what was happening in tibet and to appreciate the lives that they were leading now  bl: to be present in the moment and to see how we are interconnected  fv: exactly.  he showed people the importance of being grateful for their opportunities while having empathy for the less fortunate.  people could relate to that and theyd say hey lets show some compassion and together lets learn how to have respect for each other.  i loved adam because i saw how he was in a position as a beastie boy to make a difference for people through a cause he was so passionate about.  he was such a kind man.  he showed the world that so many of us are lucky and that we need to be kind and appreciative and compassionate every day  bl: how did they use that energy during 9/11  fv: i remember them being so completely shaken and upset.  but they were like felicia john and jc: we want to do a benefit in new york and we want it to be for new yorkers against violence.  because we feel like we have to stop for a minute and figure out what is going on.  violence is not the answer.  and within a month we were in new york doing the benefit supporting those peaceful causes so that people would keep an open mind.  and we had a lot of support.  u2 came out rem came out and a lot of artists came out to support the ideas that these brilliant people were sharing.  and it created a platform for these people to inspire each other to make change.  i think thats why i was so drawn to them and really its why i got into the music business.  im a kid from new mexico that grew up in an impoverished and abusive home and became an emancipated minor when i was 16.   i remember that music was my focus and always gave me drive when i felt like i couldnt take it anymore.  anyhow the b-boys seized the moment when they had the opportunity.  they really did their best to make a change in the world.  and for me that was worth working the 20-hour days for 15 years  bl: thats a lot of hours  fv: yes again im fortunate to have such an understanding husband  bl: noted.  what about the future  do you see adam horovitz and mike going on and recording as the beastie boys  fv: thats an interesting question\u2026  i think the beastie boys will always be the three.  they grew up together.  they were brothers.  it would just never be the same.  its been about 8 or 9 years since i stopped spending every day of my life with them so i could not say for sure but in my heart i would have to say no  bl: do your children...  does your family understand the role that you played  that you were an integral part of the coolest band that ever was  fv: i dont know.  i dont think so exactly.  i always try to put others first and not focus on myself.  it goes back to remaining stealth.  i wanted to embrace my kids as being who they were and not imposing too much of myself on them.  i think within the last couple of years or so jayden just turned 8 and jake is 7.  its funny how theyve evolved.  now they are really starting to understand music.  ive wanted them to grow up being who they were meant to be.  jayden is always dancing and the way he moves his hands to express himself reminds me so much of the way yauch used his hands.  jake is my little breakdancer b-boy and thats just all coming from him.  jayden\u2026  he just loves to rock.  ive told them a little bit about it... bl: what else are you up to  fv: i have become a strong advocate for children and education.  i have been helping build our amazing school and community at wish charter and im learning so much every day.  i am so thankful wish has become such an important part of our lives.  in our 3rd year were selected as one of six schools across the country and the only charter school by the university of kansas to become a swift knowledge development site to help reform education across the country.  district representatives educators administrators and community members come from all over the world to tour our school to observe our community and see how exciting it is to develop an inclusive environment for all children.  we are continuing to develop our educational and community parterships and our dream within the next couple of years is to build our own site.  that way we would have a permanent home and become a true development site for educators and administrators from all over the world.  what we do is not magic but is from the heart for all kids.  this school has not only changed my family but also the lives of 400 other families.  i used to think the only way i could change the world was through a huge festival to get people to listen.  but now i see us changing lives everyday \u2014 one child at a time. but i am not giving up my dream of producing an event festival or new digital idea \u2014 to bring my music and educational worlds together.  no way.  i wont give up.  i will make it happen  bl: i can see how your dream of improving education connects with the way the beastie boys advocated for social change.  i believe that adrocks sister is on the board of the ghetto film school\u2026  fv: absolutely.  people can do amazing things but sometimes everyone needs to be reminded that they have greatness inside them.  its important to have people in your life who have the ability to inspire others and remind them of their potential  bl: word.  can you tell us what it is ad-rock is saying at the end of rhyme the rhyme well  fv: haha hes saying you know i give a fuck cause im felicia.  bl:  ohhh.  how did that come about  fv: they called me and said hey\u2026  we did something special for you.  because we always like to hear your voice.  youre always there for us.  and we just always wanted to do something nice for you.  i think they were letting me know that they appreciated how much i cared.  and i think more than anything in the world that was the greatest thing they could have said to me  bl: anything else youd like to say  fv: my most powerful and amazing memories were from the side of the stage watching tens of thousands of fans in audiences all over the world singing along bouncing and just having the time of their lives.  my favorite concerts were the festivals\u2026 watching a sea of people moving and singing together so perfectly\u2026\u2026that is what it is all about in the end.  that was truly magical and there is nothing like it in the world.  i remember feeling like my heart was going to explode because i was so proud of the three gentlemen on the stage and what they meant to their fans.  thanks for letting me reminisce about a very special time in my life with some truly exceptional people\u2026   "]}
