{"eric b. & rakim": [" i aint no joke i used to let the mic smoke now i slam it when im done and make sure its broke when im gone no one gets on cause i wont let nobody press up and mess up the scene i set i like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn but think about it then youll understand im just an addict addicted to music maybe its a habit i gotta use it even if its jazz or the quiet storm i hook a beat up convert it into hip-hop form write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in deep concentration cause im no comedian jokers are wild if you wanna be tame i treat you like a child then youre gonna be named another enemy not even a friend of me cause youll get fried in the end when you pretend to be competing cause i just put your mind on pause and i can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours i wake you up and as i stare in your face you seem stunned remember me the one you got your idea from but soon you start to suffer the tunell get rougher when you start to stutter thats when you had enough of biting itll make you choke you cant provoke you cant cope you shouldve broke because i aint no joke  ", " i got a question as serious as cancer who can keep the average dancer hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling cause youre expressing the rhyme that im styling this is what we all sit down to write you cant make it so you take it home break it and bite use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits get the style down pat then its time to switch put my tape on pause and add some more to yours then you figure youre ready for the neighborhood tours the e-m-c-e-e dont even try to be when you come up to speak dont even lie to me you like to exaggerate dream and imaginate then change the rhyme around that can aggravate me so when you see me come up freeze or youll be one of those seven emcees they think that im a new jack but only if they knew that they who think wrong are they who cant do that style that im doing they might ruin patterns of paragraphs based on you and your offbeat dj if anything he play sound familiar ill wait till e say play em so imma have to diss and broke you could get a smack for this i aint no joke  ", "", "   i hold the microphone like a grudge bll hold the record so the needle dont budge i hold a conversation cause when i invent i nominated my dj the president when i emcee ill keep a freestyle going steadily so pucker up and whistle my melody but whatever you do dont miss one therell be another rough rhyme after this one before you know it youre following and fiending waiting for the punchline to get the meaning like before the moral of my story im telling nobody beats the r so stop yelling save it put it in your pocket for later cause im moving the crowd and b a record fader no interruptions and the mic is broke when im gone then you can joke cause everything is real on a serious tip keep playing and i get furious quick and ill take you for a walk through hell freeze your dome then watch your eyeballs swell guide you out of triple stage darkness when it get dark again then ima spark this microphone cause the heat is on you see smoke and im finished when the beat is gone im no joke  "]}
