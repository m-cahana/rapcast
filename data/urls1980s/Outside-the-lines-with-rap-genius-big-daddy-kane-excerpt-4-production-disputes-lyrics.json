{"big daddy kane": ["  sameoldshawn: youve kind of hinted at that before that maybe you did a little more production work on your early stuff than is commonly thought  bdk: yeah. its the type of thing where at that time i was young so i didnt know. i was just going by what i was told. raw aint no half steppin -- pretty much everything off the first album except for set it off. set it off was actually done by mark 45 king and marley did ill take you there  but other than that pretty much all that stuff is me  sos: really  bdk: yeah. half steppin long live the kane raw all that stuff is me. i mean just rhymin with biz we didnt even really do that at marleys house. i did that at my man shemshawn house in l.g. lafayette gardens and just brought it to marleys house  sos: and then somehow the credits ended up saying something a little different  bdk: yeah. see what i was told was we got the deal with warner brothers because they look at mr. magic as the air personality thats gonna play any of our songs because hes on the radio and they look at marley as the super-producer. if they thought that marley wasnt the super-producer we all lose the deal and none of us would have no label. so it needs to say produced by marley marl. i mean dont worry you gonna get your money. and my dumb ass like 18 19 years old i believed that -- oh okay  "]}
