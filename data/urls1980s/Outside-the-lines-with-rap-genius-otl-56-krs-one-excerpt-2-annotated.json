{"krs-one": ["  krs-one: you know mc shan is the beginning of my career. if it wasnt for mc shan krs-one would not exist. i start that way whenever im talking about mc shan. whenever im talking about mc shan i have to start off with: he is the creation and start of my career. and literally because you know when you have lines - and im actually thinking of the full song many people tell me this that this style is kinda different... it was his style that i was doing and many people dont know that. i mean many people do know that but if your hip hop begins in the 90s for instance you may think that the style that im doing on the south bronx is actually my style. its not. its a parody of mc shans style. and im sort of mocking or mimicking his style so in a lot of ways you can say that krs-ones actual style was mc shans style. i kinda bit his style and started my style. thats something i would never say in public  "]}
