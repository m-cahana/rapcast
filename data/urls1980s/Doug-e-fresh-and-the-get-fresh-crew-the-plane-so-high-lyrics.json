{"doug e. fresh": ["  so highso highon the plane x16  walkin on the plane i see so many faces some from out of town and distant places there could never be a question of who knows who and no tellin what most of them have been through true you cant judge a book by its cover and if im in love does that make me a lover and if you see a wrinkle does it mean im old and am i wrong for saying what i want in a song questions like these my mind it teases or i could act like a soldier and just at ease and dont think about it and dont worry about it and keep my head up high and dont ask why and think about the graduation at hawai kai when we felt good about what we did and didnt do the thought about me and you i left it up to you all up to you  but you felt that your heart would melt and got scared and fastened up your seat belt because the plane was going so high in the sky and i didnt  know that you were scared to fly but you told me by showin me in a way i cant say cause its hard to describe and left me feeling the funniest vibes of unsureness amid insecure confusion  too good to be true a dramatic illusion as you sit in seat a and i sit in seat b i want the whole world to see what you mean to me if love was able to speak mine would talk so loud me and you all alonemaking love on a cloud an uncontrollable urge  thats why im on the verge wondering of actions speak louder than wordssounds of gunfire and as we become one we feel no pain our bodies so wet that we make rain its like a mystery for the world to see but only me and you knew our destiny you might think im crazy or just too deep or too far or too gone or too wide or too steep whatever you may feel about me inside sit backrelax and enjoy the ride on the plane  so highso highon the plane x10  "]}
