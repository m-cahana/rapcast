{"beastie boys": ["", "  {children of the earth}    well i can hear the trumpets blowing screaming out the end of time look around and listen and youll see every sign the waters are polluted as the forests are cut down bombing and drilling deep below the ground check the prophecies from around the world and look around now as it all unfurls look into yourself and see what goes on get a feeling in your heart of the right from the wrong because the mother earth needs to be respected been far too long that shes been neglected race against race such a foolish waste its like cuttin off your nose to spite your face and at the end of the wars what was the cost well its clear that the earth was the one who lost we are one with her as she is one with us its unreal how she is treated so unjust as our planet grows smaller each and every day everyone affecting everyone in every way were all citizens of the world community all here together and were searching for unity over the years ive grown and changed so much things i know now years ago i couldnt touch there are things ive done that i wouldnt do again but im glad that i did cause i learned from them i just try to stay present right here right now no worries no fears and without any doubts  well its about time its about time its about time its about time its about time  cause in these times these changing times a transition is occurring and i am not blind as the pendulum swings a new age we enter and with every swing it draws closer to the center yes the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love things must run their course so we push and we shove but were here to work it out in one way or another to find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another and the true key is a trust in self for when i trust myself i fear no one else i took control of my life just as anyone can i want everyone to see its in the palm of your hand the past is gone the future yet unborn but right here and now is where it all goes on i know we can fix it and its not too late i give respect to king and his nonviolent ways i dream and i hope and i wont forget someday im going to visit on a free tibet someday im going to see us all joined as one and it would be too bad to blow it up before were done cause we long behind the rage learning from the pain the love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain im sending loving light to all that is to all creation and the life we live im not preaching bullshit just speaking my mind cause im here now and its about time  well its about time its about time its about time its about time its about time  "]}
