{"kurtis blow": ["  remember when you first found love how you felt so good kind that last forever more so you thought it would suddenly the things you see got you hurt so bad how come the things that makes us happy makes us sad well it seems to me that  joy and pain are like sunshine and rain joy and pain are like sunshine and rain  love can be bitter love can be sweet sometimes devotion and sometimes deceit the ones that you care for give you so much pain oh but its alright there both one in the same  dont it seem we go through life going up and down seems the things that turn you on turn you around always hurting eachother if it aint one thing its another but when the world is down on you loves somewhere around well it seems to me that  joy and pain are like sunshine and rain joy and pain are like sunshine and rain joy and pain are like sunshine and rain joy and pain are like sunshine and rain  over and over you can be sure there will be sorrow but you will endure where theres a flower theres the sun and the rain oh and its wonderful there both one in the same  joy and pain are like sunshine and rain joy and pain are like sunshine and rain joy and pain are like sunshine and rain joy and pain are like sunshine and rain  "]}
