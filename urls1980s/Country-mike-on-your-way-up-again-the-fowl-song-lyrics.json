{"beastie boys": ["  my papa done told me: dont put all your eggs in one basket because you might be countin your chickens before they hatch which brings us to the question: why did the chicken cross the road if i knew that i know why a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush now we all wanna be free like an eagle but we also know what its like when someone flies the coop and i think thats a real birdseye view of the situation  once around the corner once around the bend when youre on your way up again go and tell the grocer and go and tell your friend when youre on your way up again  you see the people on the way up see people on the way down when you hit rock bottom only way you can go is up now we all know its real lonely at the top so dont bite the hand that feeds ya you just might get burned patience is a virtue so you best wait your turn  once around the corner once around the bend when youre on your way up again go and tell the grocer and go and tell your friend when youre on your way up again  do unto others as you want done unto you one isnt as much as the other you know that aint true dont get your foot in the door follow your own way dont let the success fool you you wont go astray when the shoe is on the other foot and that is how it stands one of these days im takin the law in my own damn hands  once around the corner once around the bend when youre on your way up again go and tell the grocer and go and tell your friend when youre on your way up again  "]}
