which is breaking emceeing graffiti art deejaying beatboxing street fashion street language street knowledge and street entrepenurialism - trade and business. and uhh thats where yknow thats the hip-hop that that that were about. we come from the uhh the root of of kool dj herc who originated hip-hop in the early 70s and then afrika bambaata and zulu nation mmhmm who instigated something called the infinity lessons and added conciousness to hip-hop and then grandmaster flash with the invention of the mixer on to run-d.m.c. and then myself and uhh we created the stop the violence movement you may recall a song self destruction and and and so on. all of this goes to uhh uhh the idea of living this culture out and taking responsibility for how it looks and and acts in society  "]}
