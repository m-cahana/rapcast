{"beastie boys": [" im flowing prose to cons and cons to pros im scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know but beyond the concepts and emotions that rise to the interconnectedness that underlies the lies upon lies have lost their meaning the plies upon plies of consciousness that is being over and over i fall i learned to walk from a crawl its not sad its just the way and the purpose of it all  ", " now every word that you heard that i said that you felt was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt i steal feels from reels but i pay my respects paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects words are water as i court her as she is pristine words and mics fall to dust and all thats left is the feelings i give in and i win i try to never complain intentions venture to center and then they set the stage but ill remain sane making gain without pain staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain and keep it positive as painstaking as it is ill never turn back cause thats the way ive got to live ill never turn back cause thats the way ive got to live ill never turn back cause thats the way ive got to live  ", "", "   so like a cloud carries rain im gonna carry my rhyme coming like thunder with lightening timing no hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans ferment time like wine no ploys or scams like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas woke up this morning right out of a dream reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme what can i do with these bones and flesh with these animated thoughts in a world repressed im going down like the rhythms on the winds of change im keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range im flowing prose to cons and cons to pros im like toucan sam when i follow my nose im giving shouts to gandhi garvey and king his holiness and all enlightened beings ill be the one who screams it on the microphone ill be the one who brings it inside your home but the words aint mine i just pass em along for betty williams and her friends i sing this song and more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes and more crimes are committed as i say these lines  youth enough we put down the gun  "]}
