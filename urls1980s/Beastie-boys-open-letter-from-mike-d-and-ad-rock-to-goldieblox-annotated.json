{"beastie boys": ["  like many of the millions of people who have seen your toy commercial goldieblox rube goldberg & the beastie boys we were very impressed by the creativity and the message behind your ad.  we strongly support empowering young girls breaking down gender stereotypes and igniting a passion for technology and engineering.  as creative as it is make no mistake your video is an advertisement that is designed to sell a product and long ago we made a conscious decision not to permit our music and/or name to be used in product ads. when we tried to simply ask how and why our song girls had been used in your ad without our permission you sued us.
