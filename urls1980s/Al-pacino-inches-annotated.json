{"ll cool j ": ["  i dont know what to say really. three minutes to the biggest battle of our professional lives. all comes down to today and either we heal as a team or were gonna crumble. inch by inch play by play. until were finished.  were in hell right now gentlemen. believe me. and we can stay here get the shit kicked out of us or we can fight our way back into the light. we can climb outta hell... one inch at a time.  now i cant do it for ya im too old. i look around i see these young faces and i think i mean ive made every wrong choice a middle-aged man can make. i uh ive pissed away all my money believe it or not. i chased off anyone whos ever loved me. and lately i cant even stand the face i see in the mirror.  you know when you get old in life things get taken from you. i mean thats... thats... thats a part of life. but you only learn that when you start losin stuff. you find out lifes this game of inches so is football. because in either game - life or football - the margin for error is so small. i mean one half a step too late or too early and you dont quite make it. one half second too slow too fast and you dont quite catch it.  the inches we need are everywhere around us. theyre in every break of the game every minute every second. on this team we fight for that inch. on this team we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. we claw with our fingernails for that inch.  because we know when add up all those inches thats gonna make the fucking difference between winning and losing between living and dying ill tell you this in any fight its the guy whos willing to die whos gonna win that inch. and i know if im gonna have any life anymore its because im still willing to fight and die for that inch because thats what living is the six inches in front of your face.  now i cant make you do it. youve got to look at the guy next to you look into his eyes. now i think ya going to see a guy who will go that inch with you. your gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows when it comes down to it your gonna do the same for him.  thats a team gentlemen and either we heal now as a team or we will die as individuals. thats football guys thats all it is. now what are you gonna do  "]}
