{"krs-one": ["  krs-one: this line suicide its a suicide buda bye bye this was a jamaican patois lyric. very common in jamaican mc-ing the style suicide its a suicide. im telling the other mc on the opponent that youre basically killing yourself by coming to challenge krs-one. i did this on the just ice album kool & deadly and it somehow caught on i guess. a lot of people liked the flow of it so when i heard it a few times in a peoples choruses scratched a few times in peoples songs and even said in peoples lyrics - i love it all. i loved it all. anybody that knows me knows - you could use anything of krs-ones. if you can somehow innovate what i did or just use what i did to better yourself im all for it  "]}
