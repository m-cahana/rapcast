{"geto boys": ["  its f@#ked up when your minds playin tricks on ya \u2014the geto boys mind playing tricks on me  by far the most difficult skill for me to learn as ceo was the ability to manage my own psychology. organizational design process design metrics hiring and firing were all relatively straightforward skills to master compared to keeping my mind in check. over the years ive spoken to hundreds of ceos all with the same experience. nonetheless very few people talk about it and i have never read anything on the topic. its like the fight club of management: the first rule of the ceo psychological meltdown is dont talk about the psychological meltdown  at risk of violating the sacred rule i will attempt to describe the condition and prescribe some techniques that helped me. in the end this is the most personal and important battle that any ceo will face  if im doing a good job why do i feel so bad generally someone doesnt become ceos sic unless she has a high sense of purpose and cares deeply about the work she does. in addition a ceo must be accomplished enough or smart enough that people will want to work for her. nobody sets out to be a bad ceo run a dysfunctional organization or create a massive bureaucracy that grinds her company to a screeching halt. yet no ceo ever has a smooth path to a great company. along the way many things go wrong and all of them could have and should have been avoided  the first problem is that everybody learns to be a ceo by being a ceo. no training as a manager general manager or any other job actually prepares you to run a company. the only thing that prepares you to run a company is running a company. this means that you will face a broad set of things that you dont know how to do that require skills that you dont have. nevertheless everybody will expect you to know how to do them because well you are the ceo. i remember when i first became ceo an investor asked me to send him the cap table. i had a vague idea of what he meant but i didnt actually know what the format was supposed to look like or what should be included or excluded. it was a silly little thing and i had much bigger things to worry about but everything is hard when you dont actually know what you are doing and i wasted quite a bit of time sweating over that stupid spreadsheet  even if you know what you are doing things go wrong. things go wrong because building a multi-faceted human organization to compete and win in a dynamic highly competitive market turns out to be really hard. if ceos were graded on a curve the mean on the test would be 22 out of a 100. this kind of mean can be psychologically challenging for a straight a student. it is particularly challenging because nobody tells you that the mean is 22  if you manage a team of 10 people its quite possible to do so with very few mistakes or bad behaviors. if you manage an organization of 1000 people it is quite impossible. at a certain size your company will do things that are so bad that you never imagined that youd be associated with that kind of incompetence. seeing people fritter away money waste each others time and do sloppy work can make you feel bad. if you are the ceo it may well make you sick  and to rub salt into the wound and make matters worse its your fault  nobody to blame you cant blame jazz musicians or david stern with his nba fashion issues \u2014nas hip hop is dead  when people in my company would complain about something or other being broken such as the expense reporting process i would joke that it was all my fault. the joke was funny because it wasnt really a joke. every problem in the company was indeed my fault. as the founding ceo every hire and every decision that the company ever made happened under my direction. unlike a hired gun that comes in and blames all of the problems on the prior regime there was literally nobody for me to blame  if someone was promoted for all the wrong reasons that was my fault. if we missed the quarterly earnings target that was my fault. if a great engineer quit that was my fault. if the sales team made unreasonable demands on the product organization then that was my fault. if the product had too many bugs that was my fault. it kind of sucked to be me  being responsible for everything and getting a 22 on the test starts to weigh on your consciousness  too much broken stuff given this stress ceos often make the one of the following two mistakes:  1. they take things too personally 2. they do not take things personally enough  in the first scenario the ceo takes every issue incredibly seriously and personally and urgently moves to fix it. given the volume of the issues this motion usually results in one of two scenarios. if the ceo is outwardly focused she ends up terrorizing the team to the point where nobody wants to work at the company any more. if the ceo is inwardly focused she ends up feeling so sick from all of the problems that she can barely make it to work in the morning  in the second scenario in order to dampen the pain of the rolling disaster that is the company the ceo takes a pollyannaish attitude: its not so bad. in this view none of the problems are actually that bad and they neednt be dealt with urgently. by rationalizing away the issues the ceo feels better about herself. the problem is that she doesnt actually fix any of the problems and the employees eventually become quite frustrated that the chief executive keeps ignoring the most basic problems and conflicts. ultimately the company turns to crap  ideally the ceo will be urgent yet not insane. she will move aggressively and decisively without feeling emotionally culpable. if she can separate the importance of the issues from how she feels about them she will avoid demonizing her employees or herself  its a lonely job and this loneliness wont leave me alone \u2014otis redding sittin on the dock of the bay  in your darkest moments as ceo discussing fundamental questions about the viability of your company with your employees can have obvious negative consequences. on the other hand talking to your board and outside advisors can be fruitless. the knowledge gap between you and them is so vast that you cannot actually bring them fully up to speed in a manner thats useful in making the decision. you are all alone  at loudcloud when the dot com bubble burst and subsequently sent most of our customers into bankruptcy it crippled our business and devastated our balance sheet. or rather that was one interpretation. another interpretation and necessarily the official story for the company was that we still had plenty of money in the bank and were signing up traditional enterprise customers at an impressive rate. which interpretation was closer to the truth in the absence of someone to talk to thats a question that i asked myself about 3000 times. as an aside asking oneself anything 3000 times turns out to be a bad idea. in this case i had two specific difficult questions:  1. what if the official interpretation was wrong  what if i was misleading everyone from investors to employees in that case i should be removed from my position immediately  2. what if the official interpretation was right what if i was grinding my brain into sawdust for no reason at all what if i was taking the company off track by questioning my own direction in that case i should be removed from my position immediately  as is usually the case there was no way to know which interpretation was right until much later. it turned out that neither was actually right. the new customers didnt save us but we figured out another way to survive and ultimately succeed. the key to getting to the right outcome was to keep from getting married to either the positive or the dark narrative  my friend jason rosenthal took over as ceo of ning about a year ago. as soon as he became ceo he faced a cash crisis and had to choose amongst three difficult choices: 1. radically reduce the size of the company or 2. sell the company or 3. raise money in a highly dilutive way  think about those choices:  1. lay off a large set of talented employees whom he worked very hard to recruit and as a result likely severely damage the morale of the remaining people  2. sell out all of the employees who he had been working side-by-side with for the past several years jason was promoted into the position by selling the company without giving them a chance to perform or fulfill their mission  3. drastically reduce the ownership position of the employees and make their hard work economically meaningless  choices like these separate the women from the girls. tip to aspiring entrepreneurs: if you dont like choosing between horrible and cataclysmic dont become ceo. jason sought advice from some of the best minds in the industry but ultimately he was completely alone in the final decision. nobody had the answer and whatever the answer jason was the one who had to live with the consequences. so far his decision to reduce staff by letting go of primarily the most recent hires has paid off. revenue at ning is soaring and team morale is high. if it had gone worse or ultimately goes bad it will be all jasons fault and it will be up to jason to find a new answer. whenever i see jason i like to say: welcome to the show.  at times like the above its important to understand that nearly every company goes through life-threatening moments. my partner scott weiss relayed that its so common that there is an acronym for it: wfio which stands for were f#%ked its over its pronounced whiff-ee-yo. as he describes it every company goes through at least two and up to five of these episodes although im pretty sure that i went through at least a dozen at opsware. in all cases wfios feel much worse than they are\u2014especially for the ceo  techniques to calm your nerves the problem with psychology is that everybodys is slightly different. with that as a caveat over the years i developed a few techniques for dealing with myself. hopefully you find them useful too  make some friends\u2014although its nearly impossible to get high quality advice on the tough decisions that you make it is extremely useful from a psychological perspective to talk to people who have been through similarly challenging decisions. my friend bill campbell was a huge help to me as ceo but interestingly it wasnt his great success running intuit that i found most useful; it was his disastrous experience running go. through that experience and his most traumatic days at intuit like laying off 1/3 of the company bill learned a tremendous amount about how to think about excruciatingly difficult decisions from a psychological perspective  get it out of your head and onto paper\u2014when i had to explain to bill and the rest of my board that as a public company i thought that it would be best if we sold all of our customers and all of our revenue and changed business it was messing with my mind. in order to finalize that decision i wrote down a detailed explanation of my logic. the process of writing that document separated me from my own psychology and enabled me to make the decision swiftly  focus on the road not the wall\u2014when they train racecar drivers one of the first lessons is when you are going around a curve at 200 mph do not focus on the wall; focus on the road. if you focus on the wall you will drive right into it. if you focus on the road you will follow the road. running a company is like that. there are always a thousand things that can go wrong and sink the ship. if you focus too much on them you will drive yourself nuts and likely capsize your company. focus on where you are going rather than on what you hope to avoid  a final word of advice\u2014dont punk out and dont quit as ceo there will be many times when you feel like quitting. i have seen ceos try to cope with the stress by drinking heavily checking out and even quitting. in each case the ceo has a marvelous rationalization why it was ok for him to punk out or quit but none them will ever be great ceos. great ceos face the pain. they deal with the sleepless nights the cold sweat and what my friend the great alfred chuang legendary founder and ceo of bea systems calls the torture. whenever i meet a successful ceo i ask them how they did it. mediocre ceos point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. the great ceos tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. they all say: i didnt quit.
