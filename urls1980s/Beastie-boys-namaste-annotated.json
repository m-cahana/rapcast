{"beastie boys": ["  yeah a butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day as i feel this reality gently fade away riding on a thought to see where its from gliding through a memory of a time yet to come smoke paints the air swirling images through my mind like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind and i stand at the edge cautiously awaiting as time slips by carefully navigating by the stars in the sky and i sit and i think to myself and on the horizon the sun light begins to climb and it seems like its been so long since he shined but im sure it was only yesterday  a cold chill of fear cut through me i felt my heart contract to my mind i brought the image of light and i expanded out of it my fear was just a shadow and then a voice spoke in my head and she said dark is not the opposite of light its the absence of light and i thought to myself she knows what shes talking about and for a moment i knew what it was all about  "]}
