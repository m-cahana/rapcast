{"public enemy": ["  granted charlie parker died laughing. choked chickenwing perched over 50s mtv. so no way in hell did bird believing there was no competition in music will his legacy to some second-generation beboppers to rattle over the heads of the hiphop nation like a rusty sabre. but when harry allen comes picking fights with suckers adducing hiphop the new jazz like hiphop needs a jazz crutch to stand erect im reminded of pithecanthropus erectus and not the charles mingus version. b-boys devolved to the missing link between jazzmen and a lower order species out of joseph conrad. perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was of no more account than a grain of sand in a black sahara. well dont you see he had done something he had steered; for months i had him at my back--a help--an instrument. it was a kind of partnership. page 87.  hiphop being more than a cargo cult of the microchip it deserves being debated on more elevated terms than as jazzs burden or successor. given the near absence of interdisciplinary scholarship on the music the conceptual straits of jazz journalism and hiphops cross-referential complexity the hiphop historian must cast a wider net for critical models. certainly public enemys it takes a nation of millions to hold us back def jam demands kitchen-sink treatment. more than a hiphop record its an ill worldview  nation of millions is a will-to-power party record by bloods who believe like sun ra that for black folk its after the end of the world. or in pespeak: armageddon has been in effect. go get a late pass. in roll jordan roll: the world the slaves made eugene genovese offers that the failure of mainland blaks to sustain a revolutionary tradition during slavery was due to a lack of faith in prophets of the apocalypse. this lack he says derived from africas stolen children having no memories of a paradise lost that revolution might regain. machiavellian thinking might have found its way into the quarters: all armed prophets have conquered while all unarmed prophets have failed. but the observation that blacks were unable to envision a world beyond the plantation or of a justice beyond massas dispensation still resonates through our politics. four decades after garvey the cultural nationalists of the 60s sought to remedy our motherland amnesia and nationhood aversions through dithyrambs demagoguery and a counter-supremacist doctrine that pressed for utopia over reform pragmatism. its noblest aim was total self-determination for the black community. for pe that not kings is the dream that died.  the lofty but lolling saxophone sample that lures us into the lps black side could be a wake up call a call to prayer or an imitation coltrane cocktease. since were not only dealing with regenerated sound here but regenerated meaning what was heard 20 years ago as expression has now become a rhetorical device a trope. making old records talk via scratching or sampling is fundamental to hiphop. but where weve heard rare grooves recycled for parodic effect or shock value ad nauseam on show em whatcha got pe manages something more sublime enfolding and subsuming the coltrane mystique among others within their own. the martial thump that kicks in after the obligatto owes its bones to funkadelics baby years and miles daviss urban bush music. but the war chants from chuck d and flavor flav that blurt through the mix like station identification also say what was hip yesterday we save from becoming pass\u00e9. since three avant-gardes overlap here--free jazz funk hip hop--the desired effect might seem a salvage mission. not until sister ava muhammads tribute-to-the-martyrs speech fragments begin their cycle do you realize public enemy are offering themselves up as next in line for major black prophet missionary or martyrdom status. give them this much: pe paragon farrakhan excepted nobody gives you more for your entertainment dollar while cold playing that colored mans messiah role.  pe wants to reconvene that black power movement with hiphop as the medium. from the albums and interviews the program involves rabble-rousing rage radical aesthetics and bootstrap capitalism as well as a revival of the old movements less than humane tendencies: revolutionary suicide misogyny gaybashing jew-baiting and the castigation of the white man as a genetic miscreant or per elijah muhammads infamous myth of yacub a grafted devil.  to know pe is to love the agitprop and artful noise and to worry over the whack retarded philosophy they espouse. like: the black woman has always been kept up by the white male because the white male has always wanted the black woman. like gays arent doing whats needed to build the black nation. like: white people are actually monkeys uncles because thats who they made it with in the caucasian hills. like : if the palestinians took up arms went into israel and killed all the jews itd be alright. from this idiot blather pe are obviously making it up as they go along. since pe show sound reasoning when they focus on racism as a tool of the u.s. power structure they should be intelligent enough to realize that dehumanizing gays women and jews isnt going to set black people free. as their prophet mr. farrakhan hasnt overcome one or another of these moral lapses pe might not either. for now swallowing the pe pill means taking the bitter with the sweet and if they dont grow up later for they asses.  nation of millions is a declaration of war on the federal government and on that unholy trinity--black radio programmers crack dealers and rock critics. suckers liars get me a shovel. some writers i know are damn devils. from them i say i dont believe the hype. yo chuck they must be on the pipe right for sheer audacity and specificity chuck ds enemies list rivals anything produced by the black liberation army or punk--rallying retribution against the feds for the panthers fall party for your right to fight slapping murder charges on the fbi and cia for the assassinations of mlk and malcolm x louder than a bomb condoning cop-killing in the name of liberation black steel in the hour of chaos assailing copyright law and the court system caught can we get a witness. as americas black teen population are the core audience for these apbs to terrorize the state pe are bucking for first rap act to get taken out by washington by any means necessary.  were it not for the fact that nation is the most hellacious and hilarious dance record of the decade nobody but the converted would give two hoots about pes millenary desires. of the many differences between nation and their first yo bum rush the show is that nation is funkier. as george clinton learned you got to free negroes asses if you want their minds to bug. having seen yo bum rush move the crowd off the floor its a pleasure to say only zealot wallflowers will fade into the blackground when nation cues up. premiered at a sugar hill gala several nation cuts received applause from the down but bupwardly mobile--fulfilling chuck ds prediction on dont believe the hype that by treating the hard jams like seminar nation would reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard. but pes shotgun wedding of black militancy and musical pleasure ensures that nation is going to move music junkies of all genotypes. they claim were products from the bottom of hell because the blackest record is bound to sell.  pe producer and arranger hank shocklee has the ears of life and that rare ability to extract the lyrical from the lost and found. every particule of sound on nation has got a working mojo a compelling something other-ness and that swing thang to boot. shocklees reconstructive composition of new works from archival bites advances sampling to the level of microsurgery. ditto for cyborg dj terminator x who cuts incisively enough to turn a decaying kazoo into a dopebeat on bring the noise. putting into effect borgess rule that the most fleeting thought obeys an invisible design and can crown or inaugurate a secret form pe have evolved a songcraft from chipped flecks of near-forgotten soul gold. on nation a guitar vamp from funkadelic a moan from sly a growl abducted from bobby byrd arent just rhythmically spliced-in but melodically sequenced into colorful narratives. think of romare bearden.  one cut-up who understands the collage-form is pes flavor flav. misconstrued as mere aide-de-camp to raps angriest man after yo bum rush he emerges here as a duck-soup stirrer in his own right. flavs solo tip cold lampin with flavor is incantatory shamanism on a par with any of the greats: beefheart koch khomeini. you pick your teeth with tombstone chips candy-colored flips dead women hips you do the bump with. bones. nuthin but love bones.  those who dimiss chuck d as a bullshit artist because hes loud pro-black and proud will likely miss out on gifts for blues pathos and black comedy. when hes on his rhymes can stun-gun your heart and militarize your funnybone. as a peoples poet and pedagogue of the oppressed chuck hits his peak on the jail-house toast/prison break movie black steel in the hour of chaos. the scenario finds chuck unjustly under the justice innocent/ because im militant/posing a threat/ you bet its fucking up the government. chuck and 52 brothers bruised battered and scarred but hard bust out the joint with the aid of pes plastic uzi protection the s1ws security for the first world. inside the fantasy chuck crafts verse of poignant sympathy for all doing hard time. im on a tier where no tear should ever fall/cell blocked and locked i never clock it yall. his allusion to the middle passage as the first penal colony for blacks is cold chillin for real. chucks idea of a lifer or career soldier is also at odds with convention: nevertheless they could not understand that im a black man and i could never be a veteran.  as much as i love this kind of talk i got to wonder about pes thing against black women. and my dogass aint the only one wondering--several sisters i know who otherwise like the mugs wonder whassup with that too. last album pe dissed half the race as sophisticated bitches. this time around she watch channel zero a headbanger about how brainless the bitch is for watching the soaps keeping the race down. i know she dont know/her brain be trained by 24-inch remote/revolution a solution for all of our children/but her children dont mean as much as the show. whoa s.t.f.o. would you say that to your mother motherfucker got to say though the thrash is deadly. one of those riffs makes you want to stomp somebody into an early grave as flav goes on and on insinuating that women are garbage for watching garbage. in light of chucks plea for crack dealers to be good to the neighborhood on night of the living baseheads it appears pe believe the dealers more capable of penance than the sistuhs. remember the mack where the pimp figures it cool to make crazy dollar off his skeezes but uncool for the white man for sell scag to the little brothers this is from that same mentality. and dig that in black steel in the hour of chaos the one time on the album chuck talks about firing a piece its to a pop a female corrections officer. by my homegirls reckoning all the misogyny is the result of pe suffering from lop: lack of pussy. she might have a point.
