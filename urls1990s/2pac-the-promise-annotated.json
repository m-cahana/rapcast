{"az ": ["  i will give u liberty but first give me ure spirit this i must confiscate because the evil fear it. i too would be afraid of passion governed by reason an open mind 2 trying times when corruption is in season the promise that they claim 2 be completely true is hypocrisy at its finest a trick 2 silence u never will i believe a promise from the masters of the art trickery does not succeed with those with honest hearts  "]}
