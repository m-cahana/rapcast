{"o.c.": ["  alrite. alrite. lets get this out in the open. the only songs that i myself frank ocean have ever released are\u2026pyrite acura integurl & of course the songs included on nostalgia ultra. all other songs are on the internet as a result of record industry email hacks/leaks that happened some years back. several of these songs i had no hand in writing. i only laid reference vox on em because i was being paid. the rest are incomplete ideas reference songs that were sent out for placement on other artists. records that were never intended to represent me. notwithstanding i am a chill bro. as well as a sage/zen master in training. so im not angry or anything. i just had to let it at least be known. enjoy.
