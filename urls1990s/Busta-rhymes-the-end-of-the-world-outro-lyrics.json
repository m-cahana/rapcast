{"busta rhymes": ["  i would like to thank the whole entire world for absorbing such a special moment with busta rhymes. i just want to keep yall all posted keep in mind that we dont have too much time to take time for granted. we need all to make the moves necessary to get it all before they try to cut us off. motherfuckers got to really realize that if we dont bring it now we might never again find the precious opportunity like now to ever bring it again. so all my motherfuckers stay tuned  damn if i just had a little bit more time if i only knew what i know now things would be better. would it is it too late damn is it too late  outro instrumental  "]}
