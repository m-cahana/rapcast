{"lost boyz": ["  trash and vaudeville tight dresses and painted faces its time to free the lions from the circus cages  jaded baby come whisper in my ear better come closer cause the music is loud here  im the monkey that youve always been afraid of im the spirit that haunts your dreams deep inside dont you have a little bit of sympathy  dont you want to give me some affection why is it so hard  dont you get tired same smilin faces dont you get a little bit lonely hiding in crowded places  dont trust the stranger you should know better but this heart of darkness can be your shelter  i aint rich enough i really dont belong here i dont want to meet your mommy and daddy i aint good lookin but you get used to it like i did  dont you want to give me some affection why is it so hard  "]}
