{"the roots": ["  let us pause in lifes pleasures and count its many tears while we all sup sorrow with the poor theres a song that will linger forever in our ears oh hard times come again no more  tis the song the sigh of the weary hard times hard times come again no more many days you have lingered all around my cabin door oh hard times come again no more  while we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay there are frail forms fainting at the door though their voices are silent their pleading looks will say oh hard times come again no more  tis the song the sigh of the weary hard times hard times come again no more many days you have lingered all around my cabin door oh hard times come again no more  tis the song the sigh of the weary hard times hard times come again no more many days you have lingered all around my cabin door oh hard times come again no more  so many days you have lingered all around my cabin door oh hard times come again no more  "]}
