{"young mc": ["  artist: young mc album:  brainstorm song:   inside my head  chours 1: spoken  this song will discuss four main parts of the brain the cerebrum the cerebellum the limbic system and the brain stem and one individuals use or misuse of these parts  verse 1:  inside my head or inside my brain is that part of me which keeps me sane which helps me discern between right and wrong and other things im gonna talk about in this song its time for the people to know so now i tell em what goes in my cerebrum and my cerebellum the though process that helps me get dressed get up and go to school sit down and take a test it helps me determine if a girl is fine and the steps necessary to make her mine it tells me if something is cold or hot and i dont mess it up with crack coke or pot it helps my hearing taste touch and sight and smell so that i can tell that everythings alright it tells me when to get up and when to go to bed this is some of what goes on inside my head inside my head i wonder what might happen if the day came and i stopped rappin would i still have friends or be all alone do they like me for me or for the microphone and also when i go on a date to a fancy resteraunt a hundred dollars a plate and people stare is it because they recognize me or are they knee-jerk reacting to what they see im sorry let me make it somewhat clear do they look with joy or do they look with fear do they think oh wow young mc is near or do they think yo get that nigga out of here i dont know its an unfortuante case that i cant read your mind when i see your face but on the other hand you cant read mine so i guess that the status quos just fine for instance say im in a tall building looking out the window what if i illed and jumped out would it really matter to some and if they had my funeral just who would come would they cry for me after i was gone well dont worry thats not how im gonna move on cause i wanna go to heaven after i am dead but this is what i goes on inside my head  chours 2: spoken  the cerebrum is the part of the brain which is responsible for thinking reasoning problem solving and initiating resposes to external stimuli.  it is comprised of four lobes: the frontal which is concerned with speach and voluntary muscle activity the partietal which is concerned with the interpetation of sensory stimuli the temporal which is concerned with auditory stimuli or hearing and the occipital lobe which is concerned with the interpetation of visual stimuli.  it is the development of the cerebrum in humans which distinguishes us from other living creatures.  only whales and dolphins have comparable cerveal development  verse 2:  inside my head pretty women reign supreme because they enter my live and dominate my dreams i see one walking down the avenue freely and i look her up and down hoping that she dont see me then i wonder what if the girl just stopped threw me on the ground and she got on top and moved and grooved until our bodies were slick then i stop and say man thats sick but im not alone in this train of thought alot of people think it but they dont get caught they just live their lives and keep it all inside another secret that the brain will hide right i wonder what its like to live life wild i wonder which women will have my child will i be a good parent or will i be cold then i imagine im five years old im running down the street without a care in the world pubertys later so i dont think about girls mom and dad will do whatever i say they think its really cute to see their son play responsibility is like a four letter word they say they told me something ill say i never heard forget growing up ill be a kid instead because this is what goes on inside my head  chours 3: spoken  the cerebellum is located below the octipal lobe and behind the brain stem it takes impulses from the rest of the brain and helps translate them into coordinated muscle movements.  any msucualr acticity from brute strenght to a steady had requires a high degree of cerebellur input.  the brain stem is located just above the base of the skull and is the continuious connection between the brain and the spinal cord.  the lowest part of the brain stem or the medullah oblongata actually becomes the spinal cord at the medullahs lowest point and is concerned with the waking and sleeping states  verse 3:  inside my head there are so many questions to answer and self-doubt grows in my mind like cancer but i make sure that my thoughts are pure and my self-confidence is like a cancer cure so someone tell me why i think im fat when none of my friends ever think like that and could it be im not as ugly as i feel because alot of women think ive got sex appeal and is it true that im just too commercial not black enough cause im not controversial is it true what religious fanatics tell if i dont go to your church then im going to hell and is it true that im obliged to try to please everyone with music i supply and is it true that it will make me strong if i sleep with a women cause she likes my song and is it true that im not a real black man if i fall in love with somebody who needs a tan and is it true that i have to try to be some type of superhero cause im young mc and is it true that i have to watch myself because i think about sex more than anyone else and is it true that every women is fake cause she dont like me for me but for the money i make and is it true that i must be out of place since pop radio likes me im ignoring my race and is it true what some people will complain that since i made this song i must be insane hell no these are just negative thoughts and i just ignore them so i wont get caught i let my heart lead and my brain be led because this is what goes on inside my head  chours 4: spoken  the limbic system or the visceral brain is located in the area above the brain stem and below the cerebrum.  it is concerned with emotional tone habitual tendencies sexual behaviour and desires and is closely associated with the cerebrum.  this association provides an inhibition for the raw emotional output of the limbic system.  it is the artists opinion that the concept of self-control rests upon the cerebrums ability to regulate the uninhibited emotional impulses of the limbic system.  and for me the struggle continuies  "]}
