{"az ": ["", "  * poems written by shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists   please.. wake me when i am free i cannot bear captivity where my country i am told hold no significance i waited and died in ignorance but my inner eye can see a race who reigned as king in another place the green trees were rich and full and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as equals  war was gone because all was at peace but now like a nightmare i woke to see that i live like a prisoner of poverty..  please.. wake me when i am free i cannot bear captivity for i would rather be stricken blind than to live without expression of mind  {*babatunde olatunki begins to speak in another language*}  "]}
