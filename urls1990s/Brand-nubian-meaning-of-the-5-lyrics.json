{"brand nubian": ["", "   ...the poor have been made into slaves by those who teach lies. they dont teach the law of cause and effect. they make the people believe when they see it rain that a spook is producing it. but the rain is real how then can the cause be unreal  you are witnessing conditions in the world that are produced by real men but you dont see the real cause of the effect of your own suffering. because the bloodsuckers of the poor make you think that god is some mystery god  well the honorable elijah muhammad said to us that there is 5% who are the poor righteous teachers who dont believe the teaching of lies of the 10%. but this 5% are all wise and know who the true and living god is and they teach that the true and living god is the son of man the supreme being the blackman of asia. they are also known as civilized people muslims and muslim sons. here is a small percentage of people who know god and when they know god they have a duty  and that duty is to teach what you know to those who do not know. then those of us...those of us who are in pursuit of that duty have 10%--the rich the bloodsuckers of the poor the slavemakers of the poor--they hate the 5%. they have control over 85%. so they turn the 85% against the righteous teacher. this is how theyve been able to kill the prophets kill their communities. because the leaders who are the bloodsuckers of the poor have control over the minds of the masses and they feed the masses more lies about a righteous teacher so that the righteous teacher will be persecuted by the 10% not helped by the 85% so that they can kill the righteous teacher  but a new thing is happening today...a new thing is happening today...
