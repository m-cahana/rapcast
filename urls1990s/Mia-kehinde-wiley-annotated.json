{"mia x": [" with me. they live there and make art. its neat to see that-", " not led by money or pretentiousness. its a small community but you really have the space to observe and digest the culture. you go to a place where social commentary is rare and important and you can serve people. thats whats inspiring to me-finding someplace where people havent already seen themselves in a certain light.  kw: yeah i know.  m: you create that light you create that visual or image. in america everything has been done. weve had everything. and now were rerunning whats already been done.  kw: right recycling. the recycled object.  m: exactly i performed at a show at the moma. there was this big dinner there and i was seated in this hall with the mayor of new york and all these extremely wealthy art- supporting and art-buying people. there was a piece of work hanging in the hall-it was a fan. this fan was supposed to swing by the momentum of its own propeller. so while we were having dinner the fan was stopped and the guy next to me a curator at p.s.1 said look this is what art symbolizes today. like that piece of art is supposed to be moving but just to have dinner weve stopped the art. thats what new york is like today. you cant have real art happen in an institution because rich people can make the world stop. the stuff on the street is a lot more interesting.  new york there is almost a feeling of entitlement by the public\u2014this very palpable lack of surprise at being stopped in the street and being asked to be the subject of a 12-foot monumental painting. \u2014kehinde wiley  kw: i think so too. theres a freshness. i remember being in west africa and thinking about my fathers country-hes from nigeria-and i was there opening up a studio doing a lot of street casting stopping people and there was this film crew with me because we were doing a documentary on my process and i was contrasting the experience i had there with the experience i had doing the exact same street casting in places like the fulton street mall in brooklyn. and its amazing how in new york there is almost a feeling of entitlement by the public-this very palpable lack of surprise at being stopped in the street and being asked to be the subject of a 12-foot monumental painting. i think part of that is mediated by a very televisual sense of instant celebrity something thats sort of just add water-an age where reality television mediates the way that we see new faces entering our lives. whereas when i was in nigeria in places like lagos and calabar there was a very ineffable exchange where these guys were really curious but also so far removed from this artificial environment that i was creating. it gave something new to the work. in some ways there is a look in the paintings that seems a bit more fragile.  m: its like cinema when you put someone onscreen whos never been on before. you show it to them and say this is you. this is what you look like on a 60-by-60-foot screen. its a different understanding of art. take india: even though its got a major movie industry when it comes to contemporary art artists on the streets dont see themselves as artists-its like a skilled job. when theyre painting a car and they decorate it with all this crazy stuff i think wow this is amazing its something i would hang on my wall. but theyre always really shocked when i go up to them and ask them to do something for me. do you think thats what youre going for looking for ideas outside of the disposable just add water kind of thing  kw: my desire is to restart the conversation. its akin to this idea that most 18-year-olds who are going to be voting for the first time this year in the american elections were 10 and 11 years old during the 9/11 attacks-this idea that were all kind of collectively correcting and rebooting this desire to throw away the old rules. this is something that as artists we constantly deal with-throwing away the past slaying the father and creating the new.  m: yeah change. you know what really drives me mad about art is that in america the only thing you can do is to take it apart. as artists thats the best commentary you can do because theres just so much vacuous content. for example yesterday i stayed in bed for 24 hours and watched tv. i do that like every six months where i just dont answer phone calls and the only thing i do is watch television. and its insane i couldnt tell the difference between the news and an advert. its all fox news 30-second sound bites and there was nothing i got from it at all. where the fuck are all the michael moores in our culture where are the cool democrats where are cool people on television where has cleverness gone kw: the trouble is that the traditional targets have been so co-opted. its hard to know where to cast your aim. so much of what changed american society in the 60s had to do with a very strong set of targets-what we can physically do with ourselves and our bodies. now its much more subtle. its almost debilitating in a way because we cant organize either artistically or politically or socially against any specific thing because its more like an essence an ether that floats in the air poisoning our ability to really have an authentic moment.  m: thats what i miss being a real human. like im just so grateful for the 10 years that i had in sri lanka when it was in the middle of a war and i was getting shot at because now and again i remember glimpses of those times and i just go wow ill never ever see that again in my life. and im never gonna feel that and im never gonna feel for a human being like that.  kw: when was the last time you were back in sri lanka  m: just before september 11th happened. after that it was insane to even try to go back with all the new restrictions. when i was there i was already having a machine gun held to my head every five seconds and every 50 yards id have to show my id. i wasnt a singer at the time-i was just a random girl an artist. i was making films and i had just graduated from saint martins in london. i thought i was invincible. like im getting harassed and i have a british passport. i have a letter from the ministry of defence what if i were just a random tamil girl from the village. i could be dead it was the weirdest experience. i couldnt even make a movie because you cant make one without having it okayed by the sri lankan embassy. so you can only have a one-sided story. do you think art in america is like all other industries that there are certain parameters you cant go past  kw: certainly. i think ive come through the art-industrial complex-ive been educated in some of the best institutions and been privy to some of the insider conversations around theory and the evolution of art. but that doesnt necessarily get spoken about outside of a very small group. when you operate outside those rules you are changing the vernacular. i think thats partly the success of my work-the ability to straddle both of those worlds the ability to have a young black girl walk into the brooklyn museum and see paintings she recognizes not because of their art or historical influence but because of their inflection in terms of colors their specificity and presence.  thats partly the success of my work\u2014the ability to have a young black girl walk into the brooklyn museum and see paintings she recognizes not because of their art or historical influence but because of their inflection. \u2014kehinde wiley  m: yeah thats how i felt about your work the first time i saw it. it felt establishment but it was also breaking it a little bit and twisting it. do you feel a responsibility to teach something in your work  kw: thats a question i have always grappled with. is that even my job is that gonna slow you down  m: in the beginning i definitely felt a responsibility because i was representing a bunch of people who never got represented before. i felt this responsibility to correct that situation to be like look you cant discriminate against refugees and muslim people and blah blah blah . . . now i dont feel that so much . . . its complicated. hold on a second. are you there i just got stung by a bee.  kw: are you serious  m: yeah. its the first time ive ever been stung.  kw: you have to be careful with that. some people have major allergic reactions  m: i know. im wearing flower-print pants. i think he thought i was a bunch of flowers.  kw: drawn in by the flowers. thats great.  m: anyway getting back do you feel a responsibility  kw: thats a very complicated question. when i was growing up and going to art school and learning about african-american art much of it was a type of political art that was very didactic and based on the 60s and a social collective. i feel sometimes constrained by the expectation that the work should be solely political. i try to create a type of work that is at the service of my own set of criteria which have to do with beauty and a type of utopia that in some ways speaks to the culture im located in. but americans are so overly fixated on racial identity-and on identity in general.  m: i know. as an artist i could either sit there with a chip on my shoulder and just chip away every day or i could transcend all of it which really makes it about what youre actually saying-not being based on the burdens of the past but trying to make the world make more sense to you. if i actually had a chip on my shoulder and started like race bashing they would have been more used to that. in school i was like i want to be a filmmaker. and they were like well you cant be a serious filmmaker if youre not wearing a plaid shirt. you cant turn up at college in stilettos and say youre gonna be a filmmaker. they were teaching me avant-garde filmmaking where i had to make films that were like an hour long about nothing. ", " i just refused to do it you know  kw: it seems incredibly self-indulgent.  m: i just couldnt be like that because this week this is whats happening in my life: so-and-so is going to jail so-and-so got evicted im getting busted for this and blah blah blah. there was just like real-life shit going down in my house all the time. there was no need for me to go to college and learn how to film a blue screen for half an hour. i did my thesis on cb4 ", ". everyone freaked out. they tried to have me kicked out of school. they thought i was disgusting.  kw: i think theres something important in going against the grain and perhaps finding value in things that arent necessarily institutionally recognized.  m: exactly i want to find a taxi driver in india and ask him where he got the sticker that goes across his windshield. that decorative choice comes from the idea that maybe its good to tell your vehicle apart from everyone elses when you get off of break.  kw: right very real.  m: they also do it because they want to show off. if they buy a shop theyre gonna name the shop after their kid. if they drive a taxi they name the taxi after their mom.  kw: this sort of reminds me of growing up in south central los angeles back in the 80s you know where so many people were flossing down crenshaw boulevard with their lowriders and hydraulics and stuff and it was this major scene. for me it was always important to internalize that type of flossing. when i was at yale most of the students there were obsessed with this type of neo-minimalism that thought that any garish display or show of emotion or visceral beauty was something to be scoffed at. i think conversely it made me revert back to some of the more ornate or baroque features of black american culture.  at yale most of the students there were obsessed with this type of neo-minimalism. i think it made me revert back to some of the more ornate or baroque features of black american culture. \u2014kehinde wiley  m: thats exactly what happened with me. because i spent time in l.a. too growing up on gangster rap. my cousin was a gangster bitch and she knew the bloods and the crips and she was sri lankan so wed go to all these clubs down on crenshaw. then i would come back to college at saint martins and i was learning a whole other way. like having that whole 90s hip-hop from l.a. and then going to saint martins where its all the britpop stuff about being shy and hating yourself. i was a sri lankan refugee like the scum of society and then i went right to los angeles into african-american culture and it was just incredible. ive never seen black people like that in england. in england black people still live within the parameters of white society. it was an eye-opener. then id be in school and the students would be like im white and im male and i dont know what to do i hate myself. i was just like there is this contemporary culture in america thats writhing with so much good shit and bad shit that no one is really making art out of yet you know  kw: sometimes theres that tipping point where societies -embrace who they are without necessarily needing a dominant culture or center to recognize the periphery. i remember being in nigeria back in 1997 and meeting a bunch of mcs practicing their skills outside this bar and i was just like this is an amazing scene and how many people really know about what was going on in the hip-hop scene in nigeria back in the early 90s these guys were really complaining about how they just couldnt get any play at home and how most of what was consumed in terms of black culture was american. of course now you go to nigeria and its a completely different scene. its just overrun with amazing acts. and i think thats kind of indicative of a type of self-confidence that people develop when they recognize their own ability to create.  m: yeah. also it could be the sort of declining grip of the american mtv-nation culture-the fact that mtv doesnt play so much music anymore. when i would go to africa i used to get really pissed off that people would listen to 50 cent in like a mud hut and want dvd players and a gps in their suvs you know  kw: now why would that piss you off  m: i felt pissed off because i realized that you have to teach people in a clich\u00e9d way how to be happy-and happiness has become too one thing in american media. achieving happiness is not really about having a flat stomach and the best car.  kw: personally-and this comes from my experiences of seeing people from very hard lives working their way toward a sort of middle class and really wanting to embrace the signifiers for success-the question has always been who am i to tell them that thats crap you know its not for me perhaps its not my style but . . . ", " i know your feelings.  m: thats fine you can say get the suv but you cant say get the suv before you get a house. you know what i mean okay theres a kid in a mud hut. i dont want to teach him bad habits because i live in brooklyn. brooklyn new york city and i feel like im living in the dead weeds of hip-hop. i live in the graveyard of what went wrong with hip-hop.  kw: well what went wrong with gangster rap  m: its not even gangster rap-its just whats wrong with hip-hop. it became so one-dimensional; itbecame like a businessman thing. its run out of creativity. it went so far off about making money that now everyone can do it.  kw: i wonder though because i think about this quite a bit when i think of someone like jeff koons whom i admire quite a bit but aesthetically this type of emptiness is the point-this type of soullessness and devotion to the signifiers of happiness and consumption. are you prepared to say that that type of hip-hop-soulless empty hip-hop-is interesting on some level  m: well i would have said yeah it was 10 years ago. but now ive had 10 years-  kw: ", "", "  m.i.a.: i wanted to ask you about the progression of your work these days. how are you finding it because new york is a really different place to make art compared to what it used to be.  kehinde wiley: i came here almost 10 years ago now. it was my first experience of making a life for myself outside of school and my career kind of snowballed at once. so theres really not much in the way of an alternative experience for me to contrast it with. these days im spending quite a bit of time on the road which finally has allowed me to get some perspective. im starting a new project where i open up studios in different nations and do street casting. i just got back from brazil and nigeria and senegal. actually tomorrow im leaving for new delhi.m: does leaving new york change your art  kw: that type of process becomes the work in many ways-physically removing yourself from what your work was based on before. by and large what id been doing was mining the streets of african america using a sort of urban vernacular. that changes radically when you remove yourself physically especially around the world.   m: manhattan seems pretty developed you know what i mean like it has peaked in culture. the village voice called it mchattan. its just become impossible for young creative artists to live in new york.  kw: where do you find it most fruitful to work  m: i think traveling really helps. i know some musicians who have studios in trinidad. theres a collective of artists and painters there now who went to central saint martins college  its not funny anymore  m: yeah its not funny anymore. its good youre taking your work everywhere and youre making it global. i think all relevant work needs to be like that.  kw: one of the really great things about working in lagos is that its such a crazy assault on the senses. the population has been rising since oil was discovered there in the late 60s but public sculpture has been there since even before the colonial years. all my models are asked to choose which pose theyre going to assume and those poses are derived from portraits of former colonial masters or generals or military dictators or what have you many of them cast in public squares. what comes out of peoples minds about which person theyd prefer to be now that theyve been asked to sort of open their eyes to whats been there in their own backyard-  m: i have this artist i work with called afrikan boy. he was on my album and hes from lagos nigeria and hes always like i want to be the african dream i think thats so cool. i like the way he represents more than that modern outsider.  kw: if i were going to paint you if i could paint you as any historical figure who would it be now you have to realize its all your look and feel but im asking you about the pose.  m: a historical figure  kw: and think about it in terms of a preexisting iconic work of art. for instance when ice-t came by he wanted to be this really great painting of napoleon by ingres.  m: its really hard. there are so many people who -inspire me. ill have to think about it and e-mail you.  kw: okay.
