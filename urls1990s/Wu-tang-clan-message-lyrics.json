{"kabe hiawatha kamene": ["", "   i have nothing but respect for our young people and what theyre doing. my thing is we as adults did not stand strong and on our square to bring our young people through this process. i know i was the young person that had to fend for himself in the streets of new york. i know what happened with our young people i say look i aint mad at you know no matter what i hear i know that you are moving through a process because they are attempting to destroy the community so theyre using you. they are buying you out. but we as adults got to buy them back. im ready to compete with anybody for our young peoples minds. and what we have to is change the paradigm of how were interacting with them deal with them from a heartfelt place where they can understand. you see because whether you realize it or not its you theyre shooting in the streets. you young brothers theyre the ones that are being shot. so with this entertainment or with this music maybe i dont like what i hear maybe that i dont like some of the words i hear maybe that i dont like the direction but i think theyre doing a pretty good job considering that we as men the adult men did not cover that when we shouldve covered that. and protected them when we shouldve protected them. and brought them up that so when we see an artist acting in a most inappropriate way where is the father in this where is that male mentor that can be there we as black men must take on the responsibility as the honorable elijah muhammad told malcolm is that a nation is only as strong as its weakest family. and we have got to create nations. we have to create relationships between the african man and the african woman that creates a viable nation  "]}
