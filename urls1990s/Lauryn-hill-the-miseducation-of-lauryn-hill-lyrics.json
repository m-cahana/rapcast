{"lauryn hill": ["", "   my world it moves so fast today the past it seems so far away and life squeezes so tight that i cant breathe and every time i try to be what someone else has thought of me so caught up i wasnt able to achieve  but deep in my heart the answer it was in me and i made up my mind to define my own destiny  i look at my environment and wonder where the fire went what happened to everything we used to be i hear so many cry for help searching outside of themselves now i know his strength is within me  and deep in my heart the answer it was in me and i made up my mind to define my own destiny  and deep in my heart... and deep in my heart the answer it was in me and i made up my mind to define my own destiny  "]}
