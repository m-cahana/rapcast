{"az ": ["  nov-22-88  dear beethoven  i felt compelled 2 write u. i cant really complain but i really feel good vibes from u. im almost sure well be very close friends. i would have never guessed that u+i would be friends. but as the old saying goes... wait how does that saying go forget it u get the point i want u 2 know that u can tell me anything and if u ever need a shoulder 2 cry on u can cry on mine. i have so many good thoughts about what lies ahead 4 us and it is my hope that they all come true. as u will soon find out i do not spare words i say what i feel. so if something i say scares u please dont panic because i tend to get over emotional. my heart usually leads me 2 fast and thats probably why i always get hurt. so if it seems as though im moving 2 fast please slow me down talking 2 u on the phone was such a good feeling 4 me. i was beginning 2 feel alone & out of the blue i meet u & its almost like ive known u 4 years. we have so much in common. we both love prince we have both had broken hearts and we both adore candles what else could i ask 4 c u 2morrow beethoven  4 eternity tupac shakur  p.s. my # is 332-4725    "]}
