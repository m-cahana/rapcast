{"az ": ["  secrets r hidden within the clouds of darkness and in this place no one dares 2 breathe in fear of self-expression it has been this way forever and a day until she came 2 shine with a spark of innocence and questions only 2 be answered with darkness not just darkness but the silent kind that steals your soul and kills your mind there was no compassion for this thriving star only exploitations and confused jealousy u saw no hope and brought the end never acknowledging the star within  "]}
