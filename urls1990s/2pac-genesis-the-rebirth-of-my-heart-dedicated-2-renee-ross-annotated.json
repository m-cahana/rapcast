{"az ": ["  first there was nothing not even the faint echo of a song loneliness was daily 4 me until u came along there was a gleam of stars in your eyes i thought id  never feel this way again but u were the one 2 reach into my heart and find in me a friend i could not ignore the magnetism that i felt when u were near and any problems plaguing my mind would suddenly disappear it was the rebirth of my heart the day u became my friend because i knew from the moment i held u that i would find love again  "]}
