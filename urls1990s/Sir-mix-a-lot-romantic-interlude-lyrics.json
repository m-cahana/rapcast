{"sir mix-a-lot": ["  while driving i was thinking as you slept in my lap i was thinking of the things we could be doing baby back at my flat you know what i mean oh the sun was rising i had driven all night and be weary at the wheel  i looked down at you while you were sleeping your beauty seems so unreal you open your eyes and said mix-a-lots hours of sleep cos you are on my mind why dont you search for my hidden treasure theres no telling what youd find  by this time i was tripping girl youre such a tease but it was love baby not a one night stand youre not a sleaze girl oh  a romantic interlude... ", "", "  you were in the crowd at my party girl i did nothing but stare i looked straight in your eyes and i sing lets do it but you didnt even care oh girl  but now were all alone and your looking oh so fine i like to whisper my two things in your ear and try to blow your mind baby doll oh  put your head up on my chest feel the pounds of my heart rest assured once i lay my foundation we would never fall apart girl  these crowds are paths that haunt me at night call them romantic dreams but its so realistic i toss and i turn and i wake in a sweaty scream ah  a romantic interlude...   you woke up with a worried look on your face something was on your mind you got out of bed and walked towards the window and stared through my venetian blinds you would turn and look at me as you stood wrapped in lace i crept up behind you and held you tight and a tear ran down your face oh baby  you said now you got what you want dont you wanna leave i said before its love girl not a one night stand your not a sleaze ah  that frown soon turned to a smile you realised i was deep deep in love in the holistic sample of sophistication in other words my freak  i knew this songs a hard bit too but the test songs full of grief making songs full of heartbreaking regret its not my belief girl to see your smile is all i want your tears i exclude the next time you see me you crave whatever romantic interlude  a romantic interlude  "]}
