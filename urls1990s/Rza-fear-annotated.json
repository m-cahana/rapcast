{"rza": ["  i was afraid as a child. i was afraid of everything. i was scared of water--i couldnt swim--i was scared of trucks on the turnpike and mostly i was scared of ghosts. but at some point i realized something. a ghost is something you create yourself--a mans mind makes it happen. if there were nobody on earth would a ghost still have a chance to spook somebody no. you manifest ghosts through fear. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the words of marcus garvey resonated with me. he said fear is a state of nervousness only fit for children. men should not fear. the only thing man should fear is god. to fear anything other than god is to offend god. i carry that to this day: enlightened men do not fear.
