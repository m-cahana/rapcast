{"arrested development": ["  yeah arrested development its better to write for ourselves and have no public than to write for the public and have no self yeah yeah  i stand for children innocence in they eyes playing under blue skies trying out fake cries to see they mama sympathize wanting they new toys thinking it a bring em joy thinking mom and dad are wack but later on they realize  children playing in the dirt getting wet in the rain falling till they learn that part of life is pain crawling till they learn that walking is another thing and running should come only when walking is no type of strain  i stand for beauty earth sky woman man or other worldly things like birth strife and death again and things that we cant touch like love faith and sacrifice things that we like much like good food and moon light  cloud formations clear blue skies four season leaves and the colors that stop by great songs great art great books and stories unrecognized underdogs that later gain glory  the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am  i stand for truth political or spiritual and i know the truth can hurt but id rather hear it though whether truth about the past present future or all i know the man that hates truth is the man who will fall i know that every single issue boils down to sin  and the only way to kill sin is from within and the man who points his finger at everyone else has got 4 other fingers pointed back to himself  and that people dont change cause of words alone yet a nation can be moved by one person whose strong and truth can be buried for moments of time but like the last day buried things are bound to rise are bound to rise are bound to rise  the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am  as i stand so i rise lift my tears up to the sky  i stand for something or everything i fall for even when im wrong yo you know my views we choose most of our paths and thats just the truth even if most of our ways lead to further blues  and sometimes i stand for nothing i just sit and listen cause no matter how much i got theres things im missing so when its all done and said i stand for this when its all done and said i stand for this when its all done and said i stand for this  children beauty truth and something that stirs my insides inspires my very life cause bottom line for everyone is you stand or sit you stand or sit you stand or sit you stand or sit  as i stand so i rise lift my tears up to the sky  the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am the things that i stand for tell who i am  "]}
