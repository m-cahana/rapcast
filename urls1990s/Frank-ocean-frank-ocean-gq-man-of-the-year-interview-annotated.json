{"": [" gq: gq: you were born in long beach california but moved to new orleans at age 5. when is the first time you realized you wanted to write and perform music frank ocean: fo: i feel like i was writing as i was learning to talk. writing was always a goto form of communication. and i knew i could sing from being in tune with the radio. i would listen to whatever my mom played in the car\u2014the big divas: whitney mariah celine anita baker. then i got exposed to prince. i think it was the beautiful ones. he was screaming at the end. and this lady who was playing it was saying aint no man scream like prince. and i was like thats fucking awesome.  gq: your dad had left when you were 6 so your mom raised you on her own. frank ocean: i havent seen him since. and for a while you know we were not middle-class. we were poor. but my mom never accepted that. she worked hard to become a residential contractor\u2014got her masters with honors at the university of new orleans. i used to go to every class with her. her father was my paternal figure. hed had a really troubled life with crack heroin and alcohol and had kids he wasnt an ideal parent to. i was his second chance and he gave it his best shot. my grandfather was smart and had a whole lot of pride. he didnt speak a terrible amount but you could tell there was a ton on his mind\u2014like a quiet acceptance of how life had turned out. he was a mentor at aa and na and i would go with him to meetings.  gq: when did you start recording frank ocean: i booked my first studio at like 12 or 13. somewhere in that season of my life singing along with the radio became me wanting to be on radio you know. and writing langston hughes replica poems became me wanting to write like stevie wonder. my dad had been a singer and keyboardist. so my mom was like youre going to follow that bum maybe you should just go to law school.  gq: you stayed in new orleans until after katrina then drove cross-country with just $1100 in your pocket. what made you move to los angeles frank ocean: i had been putting together these demos that i was going to properly record in a real studio in l.a. so i saved up money doing sheetrocking and i drove out with my girlfriend at the time. i was only supposed to be there for six weeks. i dont feel like i ever made a conscious decision to stay six years. you just kind of roll. the first four and a half years was me in the studio every day writing songs for other people. i had jobs too\u2014eleven jobs. i worked at kinkos fatburger subway\u2014i was a sandwich artist\u2014and i was a claims processor at allstate insurance.  gq: so how did you go from fatburger to writing songs for brandy and justin bieber and john legend frank ocean: were talking about hundreds of things that happened. one night i went to a listening party just to pick up my backpack from a friend. next thing i know im in this studio and everybodys putting their laptops on the pool table playing songs through these big-ass speakers. it was crazy. and they wanted me to play so i plugged in and they were like oh shit. there were producers there and they said you should come up to the studio and write. so i did. id sit in those rooms for hours. but i wouldnt write any line that was as good as the lines being written in the rooms next to me. it was just like: i had to elevate. i was looking at it like an athlete then\u2014like i just wanted to be better than everybody else. i hadnt gone through anything emotionally yet. i had never been in love. i had never been heartbroken. when that happened thats really what changed everything. that turned me into a real artist. it made the difference between somebody hearing something of mine and being like wow this is a fresh approach and somebody hearing something and crying you know  gq: youre talking about the relationship you wrote about on your tumblr page\u2014the one that you likened to being thrown from a cliff when you were 19. how did that change your songwriting frank ocean: it became effortless. like breathing. because now i have something i really need to say. it was mindfuck.net. it was a floodgate. it opened up the works.  gq: def jam reportedly signed you as a recording artist in 2009 but didnt open up its checkbook at that point to help you record. the next year you met tyler the creator and the other members of odd future. how important was that frank ocean: i was at a real dark time in my life when i met them. i was looking for just a reprieve. at 20 or 21 i had i think a couple hundred thousand dollars ", " its still sprinkling a bit when we dive back into the hired lexus and head across the east river to the museum of the moving image in queens. ive suggested it because i know oceans love of movies is so engulfing that theyve become a part of his vocabulary. on his first album he sampled some of the dialogue in stanley kubricks eyes wide shut and he tells me he got the inspiration for his hit song super rich kids from steven soderberghs traffic. he has said that he sees writing a song as making a photograph out of materials that arent visible.  so its no surprise when ocean whips out his phone and starts taking pictures\u2014of the men in black 3 monster exhibit of the weird installation with beanbag chairs even of the angular stairways. but the highlight is when we come upon a collection of vintage arcade games. anyone who saw oceans performance on snl has an inkling of his love of games. he finished his set that night by retreating to play galaga as john mayer riffed on guitar. now as he spots the original pong super breakout asteroids galaxian donkey kong and frogger games all in a row he steps more quickly as if greeting old friends.  this i realize is a sort of frank ocean version of heaven. because these arent just decommissioned museum pieces. you can buy tokens and actually play. i buy four and he chooses battle zone in which you try to sink things that appear on the horizon. his first game he scores 7000 points and the machine prompts him to type his initials in the winners circle: cfo in seventh place. his fourth game he racks up 12000 points\u2014second place. but when i congratulate him he points to the number one score: its 12000 too. im the same as first place says the man who must be better than all those other pieces of shit. and then we get back in the car.  ", "", "   gq: is it true that you wrote the songs for channel orange in three weeks frank ocean: yeah then i worked on them for nine months\u2014a typical gestation period.  gq: youre something of a perfectionist i gather. frank ocean: john mayer and i were talking in rehearsal before snl and he was like you love to take the hardest way. you dont always have to. but i dont know about that. its like billy joel says in that song vienna. when the truth is told / that you can get what you want or you can just get old. we all know we have a finite period of time. i just feel if im going to be alive i want to be challenged\u2014to be as immortal as possible. the path to that isnt an easy way but its a rewarding way.  i never think about myself as an artist working in this time. i think about it in macro. i feel like elton john just made tiny dancer. he just made that shit like last night. jimi hendrix just burned his fucking guitar onstage. right freddie mercury just had the half mike stand in his hand in the fucking stadium. prince was just on the mountain in under the cherry moon. and i was there. thats how i look at it. like this shit just went down. you see the mastery that im surrounded by how on earth am i going to take the easiest way a friend of mine jokes that i have a painstaking royalty complex. like maybe i was a duke in a past life. but all you have is 100 percent. period.  gq: lets talk about your open letter on tumblr. posting that mustve felt like the hardest way. frank ocean: yes absolutely.  gq: so why did you do it were some people raising questions about the male pronouns in a few of the songs frank ocean: i had skyped into a listening session that def jam was hosting for channel orange and one of the journalists very harmlessly\u2014quotation gestures in the air very harmlessly\u2014wrote a piece and mentioned that. i was just like fuck it. talk about it dont talk about it\u2014talk about this. no more mystery. through with that.  gq: youd written the letter back in december for inclusion in the liner notes. were you afraid of the aftermath when you finally posted it in july frank ocean: the night i posted it i cried like a fucking baby. it was like all the frequency just clicked to a change in my head. all the receptors were now receiving a different signal and i was happy. i hadnt been happy in so long. ive been sad again since but its a totally different take on sad. theres just some magic in truth and honesty and openness.  gq: exactly how did your perspective change frank ocean: whatever i said in that letter before i posted it seemed so huge. but when you come out the other side now your brain\u2014instead of receiving fear\u2014sees oh shit happened and nothing happened. brain says self im fine. i look around and im touching my fucking limbs and im good. before anybody called me and said congratulations or anything nice it had already changed. it wasnt from outside. it was completely in here in my head.  gq: did you worry it would derail your career frank ocean: i had those fears. in black music weve got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance in regard to that issue. it reflects something just ingrained you know. when i was growing up there was nobody in my family\u2014not even my mother\u2014who i could look to and be like i know youve never said anything homophobic. so you know you worry about people in the business who youve heard talk that way. some of my heroes coming up talk recklessly like that. its tempting to give those views and words\u2014that ignorance\u2014more attention than they deserve. very tempting.  some people said hes saying he fell in love with a guy for hype. as if thats the best hype you can get in hip-hop or black music. so i knew that if i was going to say what i said it had to be in concert with one of the most brilliant pieces of art that has come out in my generation. and thats what i did. why can i say that why i dont have to affect all this humility and shit is because i worked my ass off. i worked my face off. and the part that you love the most is the easiest part for me. so ill do it again.  gq: im sure if youd wanted an excuse not to reveal the relationship you could have found ten people in the industry who would have said wait. frank ocean: the pitch is youll encounter less resistance in life if you say no im going to just keep dating girls.  but then youre minimizing the resistance that youre feeling from yourself on the inside. theres so much upkeep on that shit. so much upkeep on a lie. but at least everybody else is cool with how you carry on with your life. thats what they say. but know what fear does to your strength. you dont even feel smart or capable. you just feel broken\u2014and not just your heart. just a broken person.  gq: so do you consider yourself bisexual frank ocean: you can move to the next question. ill respectfully say that life is dynamic and comes along with dynamic experiences and the same sentiment that i have towards genres of music i have towards a lot of labels and boxes and shit. im in this business to be creative\u2014ill even diminish it and say to be a content provider. one of the pieces of content that im for fuck sure not giving is porn videos. im not a centerfold. im not trying to sell you sex. people should pay attention to that in the letter: i didnt need to label it for it to have impact. because people realize everything that i say is so relatable because when youre talking about romantic love both sides in all scenarios feel the same shit. as a writer as a creator im giving you my experiences. but just take what i give you. you aint got to pry beyond that. im giving you what i feel like you can feel. the other shit you cant feel. you cant feel a box. you cant feel a label. dont get caught up in that shit. theres so much something in life. dont get caught up in the nothing. that shit is nothing you know its nothing. vanish the fear.  as we make our way back from astoria ocean tells me that hes got at least five projects in the works among them a song he wrote for quentin tarantinos django unchained; songs hes working on for alicia keys and beyonc\u00e9; songs for his own third album; and a european tour which he says he wants to model on pink floyds the wall tour. hes even thinking about maybe opening his own arcade though later hell post on tumblr that this idea is morphing.  he is considering buying a place in new york city. he needs a break from l.a.s relentless sunshine he says and right now manhattan is giving him exactly that: the rain is coming down in sheets. we pull up to his soho hotel and he asks if we can idle while he runs in to get studio-ready. a few minutes later he emerges laptop in hand. hes switched his contacts out for glasses and changed into what looks like board shorts and another supreme hoodie this one maroon. its 9 p.m. on a friday as we head back to jungle city. pharrell is out in brooklyn waiting for jay-z to take the stage. but not ocean. he has a song to write.  amy wallace is a gq correspondent.  "], "amy wallace": [" yes he made the album of 2012. just ask him hell tell you. but that was just the second biggest moment of frank oceans year. here while wearing the sport coats of the season and surrounded by his whole odd future crew the ascendant singer opens up to amy wallace about his crazy year\u2014including the bomb he dropped on the hip-hop world.  if frank ocean wanted to play you a song youd drive across town in the pouring rain right thats how weve ended up at jungle city a sound studio in manhattans chelsea neighborhood. when we walk in ocean leading the way pharrell williams turns down the music and greets him warmly. here you are the prolific rapper and producer tells him. youve walked in at the right time.  sweet ocean replies picking up pharrells diamond-studded gold chain that sits\u2014fat as a tow rope\u2014at the edge of the mixing board. ocean dressed in a gray supreme hoodie jeans and black wallabees smiles as he dons the weighty necklace\u2014it jibes with the new rolex on his left wrist the cartier juste un clou bracelet on his right. in a bit hell instagram a bejeweled portrait of himself but first he unveils three new tracks stored on his phone that pharrell pronounces crazy with a lot of comprehensive layers just sort of living harmoniously. when ocean says he worries a rap number called blue whale is risky because im rhyming pharrell shakes his head.  thats not risky. that thought is dead he says. its like you know i rhyme too.   turning to me pharrell says i always call him james taylor. hes probably the closest thing to a writers perfect exemplification of the unconscious. all the songs are like movies. all you need to do is close your eyes.  now its pharrells turn to spin a track-in-progress. they listen bobbing their heads slightly occasionally both bursting into song. when the room is quiet again ocean says the song feels like a rubiks cube melodically. you want something emotionally rich on that you know what im saying but if i listen to it enough i could map a way out. before we exit they agree ocean will come back later this evening to work on it. pharrell is attending the first show of jay-zs eight-night run at the brand-new barclays center in brooklyn but he says hell come back too. aint no afterparty more important than this.  map a way out\u2014its a phrase ocean will use more than once during the next four hours as we talk about his life and especially his last few months. hes still just 25 but it feels like he packed ten years worth of living into 2012 alone releasing a heralded album channel orange in july and headlining saturday night lives season premiere in september. throughout this period he has also been handling the reverberations of something he revealed on tumblr just before channel oranges debut: his memories of an intimate relationship with his first love a man\u2014a rare admission in the macho world of hip-hop and r&b.  its important to ocean to be the master of his own identity: last year he changed his name from lonny breaux to christopher francis ocean drawing on frank sinatra and the original oceans 11 film for inspiration. and yet he admits that the failed relationship he mentioned on tumblr sent him spinning out of control rocking him even as it improved his musicality transforming him from a man with skills to a skillful man with something he suddenly was burning to say. what was going through his mind this summer he tells me was something like this: if im going to say this im going to be better than all you pieces of shit. what you going to say now you cant say oh theyre only listening to him because he said this. no theyre listening to me because im gifted and this project is brilliant.  "], "o.c.": [" a nice car a beverly hills apartment\u2014and i was miserable. because of the relationship in part and the heartbreak in part and also just miserable because of like just carting that around. and here was this group of like-minded individuals whose irreverence made me revere. the do-it-yourself mentality of of really rubbed off on me.  gq: they inspired you to record your first album nostalgia ultra on your own dime and release it for free right def jam had signed lonny breaux then this frank ocean guy puts out an internet sensation that makes a lot of best-albums lists. when they tried to sign you again was it satisfying to say oh you already have frank ocean: yeah i just told them give me $1 million if you want the next album.
