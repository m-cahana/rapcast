{"black sheep ": ["  now i know what is at stake all the hurt my heart must take we call it life ive been wounded more than once i dont know where it went so wrong  i got into the game and nothing stays the same when youre willing to risk it all  i cant save you but ill keep the pieces left of me so i let it go cause i cant escape it and it keeps on breaking now i see my desire is getting myself into the line of fire  and my words may fall like stones i will make it on my own in this life do we ever really know if the road will take us home  if im lost and confused and ive got nothing to lose i will do it all again  i cant save you but ill keep the pieces left of me so i let it go cause i cant escape it and it keeps on breaking now i see my desire  unprotected out in the open where can i find shelter when the flames get higher in the line of fire  "]}
