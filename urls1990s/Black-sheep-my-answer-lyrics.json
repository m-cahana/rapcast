{"black sheep ": ["  why did i let you in why dont i shut you out i cant believe the words that tumble from your mouth  youre always up and down these elevator moods are killing something that i thought was true  sometimes you turn so cold my tears are falling snow i try to understand youre a complete unknown  the questions that you ask they rattle round my head but do you love me as much as you love you  this is my answer ill burn you up and you can watch me soar this is my answer you can bet ill pay you back for sure  why should i feel like this why dont i shake it loose you cant appreciate whats right in front of you  youre always up and down these elevator moods are killing something that i thought was true  i try to talk to you but youre an empty space let you hear my song but you just hit erase  the questions that you ask they rattle round my head but do you love me as much as you love you  this is my answer...
