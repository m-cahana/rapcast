{"az ": ["  there r no words 2 express how much i truly care so many times i fantasize of feelings we can share my heart has never known the joy u bring 2 me as if god knew what i wanted and made u a reality id die 2 hold u or 2 kiss u or merely to see your face my stomach quivers my body shivers and my heart increases pace 2 give me $ or lots of gold would not be the same 2 me i prayed and watched the distant stars and finally u came 2 me  faithfully yours tupac amaru shakur  "]}
