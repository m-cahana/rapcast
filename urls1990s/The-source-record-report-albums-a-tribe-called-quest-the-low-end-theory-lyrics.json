{"a tribe called quest": ["  jive records production: artist rating: 5  what do you do for an encore after making one of the most ground-breaking unique and outstanding hip-hop albums ever instead of moving ahead to an uncharted musical plateau that may be over everyones head the tribe have veered off to the side molding their jazz-infused samples with fat hardcore beats to give their progressive sound a streetwise edge  the most prevalent theme on this record is the tribes disillusionment with the music industry. song topics address shady promoters bootleggers and the greedy insensitive record labels that rip-off artists. meanwhile tip and ali drop some more fat loops from their secret sample vaults. the tracks are kept simple and feature the type of fat drum beats that can be heard from a boomin system three blocks away. instead of just throwing a beat over a loop the tribe combine distinct pieces of music program their own beats and transform their samples into a sound that is truly their own. they add the right touch--whether its a live bass with singing on q-tips verse from abstract or the jazzy sax loop on phifes butter.  q-tip has already proven he is a highly skilled lyricist with his own distinct style and once again he flows lovely dubbing himself the abstract poet. those who questioned phifes microphone techniques on the first album will swallow those doubts as he practically steals the show on this one. phife provides a more straight-up b-boy approach to complement tips mellow vibes  other outstanding cuts include buggin out an uptempo jam with a catchy bassline rap promoter with its chunky guitar samples showbiz featuring brand nubians lord jammar and sadat x and ex-ultimate force member diamond d and scenario a duet with the leaders of the new school that feature some incredible lyrics from busta bhymes. theres no sophomore jinx to be found here--only real hip-hop  "]}
