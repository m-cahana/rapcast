{"o.c.": ["  i was raised christian. only had a few friends from different religions growing up. these days ive got family from agnostic to islam. my grandmother was pentecostal evangelical. she brought much of that fire and brimstone back to her household. my uncle tony said the other kids teased him and his siblings called them holyrollers. so as you may or may not expect my mother was and still is less than imposing when it comes to a particular system of belief. i was a practicing catholic for a short time. me and moms started going to separate churches when i was like 13. i never sang or played in the church though unfortunately. i remember being kind of intimidated by the idea of it actually. church was the hood julliard to me. all the coldest musicians came out of there. the lady in the video\u2026summa cum laude.
