{"o.c.": ["  currently on a long ass plane ride. going through my own little existential crisis. i wish i could talk to you all as friends. & im tempted but the truth is youre a mixed crowd. so ill spare the details\u2026 for now. unfortunately this emo shit is running concurrently with the most progressive weeks of my career so far. id like to enjoy the success more. but.. i am experiencing success. which is more than many could ever say. i dont have any noteworthy or overwhelming gripes about this business. i may call certain people/institutions out for their bullshit from time to time. but the way i see it i make a decent living doing exactly what the fuck i want. how could i not be grateful besides im not famous. maybe a little popular. i do think social networks can make you feel a little bit more poppin than you actually are though. hahaha. anyhow im gonna get a dog soon. i know it might not make sense.. i mean ill be/have been traveling a lot more frequently than im used to. but the companionship just might keep me off the proverbial ledge. what do you think of this guy  "]}
