{"outkast": ["  the laurel and hardy of phuture rap  they dont come much crazier or more outrageous than outkast their physical presence turning out to be every thing that their funky futurist classic stankonia album suggests. this is true of their backing singers too and also the brilliantly-primed musicians who groove around looking coolndeadly for 30 minutes before big boi and andre the latter in skyscraper high afro and all-in-one padded purple jumpsuit come bounding onstage.  britain and the world at large may have just tuned into outkast but all three albums prior to stankonia have been conceptual and sonic delights. listen to supercaddilacmusik atliens and aquemini and youll discover a cache of fiery visions and mercurial riches. with their heavy patois and alternatively enraged and comic raps they are the laurel and hardy of phuture rap. and once the prescient straight-to-the jugular protest of their gasoline dreams sets the scene they raid their past joyfully and seemingly at random.  stankonia establishes outkast as the premier studio maestros of the moment but live their links to older crazier traditions \u2013 draw in from screen comedy medicine shows street life \u2013 is joyously apparent. the deep soul and southern funk flows from the past far out into cyberspace but its all bounded by rabid confidence and the wide open humour evident in both the conciliatory ms jackson and the celebratory gender-appeasing call before i come.  andre whos stripped down to the waist by midway point is the most riveting performer to grace a london stage since prime-time prince. between them the duo seem to have invented their own language and when boi is laying down the law and dre is momentarily lost for words he stands grinning admiring his flexing plecs twitching in time to the beat. sweet simultaneously a brilliant gimmick and the most vital funknrapnroll band youve ever seen or heard outkast deliver on every level. to think eminem asked these guys to support him \u2013 hes obviously a far braver man than we ever suspected.
