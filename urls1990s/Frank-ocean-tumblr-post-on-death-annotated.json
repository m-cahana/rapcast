{"o.c.": ["  i cant save the world. my sun will die eventually. one convenient part of being creative and well-resourced in life though is that you can make a point to never be bored. oh and you can seclude yourself from the voices of fools. if you love me\u2026 when im done let me vibrate in peace.
