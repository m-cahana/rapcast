{"snoop dogg ": ["  no theyre not the new death row    because tde did it completely different than death row did it. death row did it with a gangster approach. we...we were smashin on niggas we was fuckin people up. we was..determined to be the hardest meanest baddest coldest roughest toughest in the game. that was our mission. uhh..tde. rappers. theyre peaceful they love they get down. they got rappers from everywhere and they represent hip-hop and they dont represent negativity and violence. and tryin to mash and disrespect it. so its like that how death row came.. we came out disrespectin eazy e and anyone who had a problem with dr. dre.    that was our first get down. it was fuck dem niggas up first. thats not tde mentality. their mentality is cool with everybody. kendrick lamar flipped out on everybody. thats that death row influence that may have cause him to backslide and feel a certain way. which i support fully and his thoughts in what he said...cause im from the west coast fuck errbody who got a problem with it.    but i dont feel like tde and death row are the same thing in any way. i feel like death row paved the way for tde...to do it in their own way... so they can stay around 20 years from now.    can ya dig that  "]}
