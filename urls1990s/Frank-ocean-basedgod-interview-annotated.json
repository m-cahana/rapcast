{"o.c.": ["  frank: aite so imma have my red bull. this aint really relaxing but okay. so umm first of all thank you for your time basedgod.  basedgod: mr. ocean yes sir thank you.  frank: you never know what someones going through they say. what would you say the average commenter looks like on the internet lets say you put out a song in like two hours and you go on a blog and theres a hundred comments already... im tryna understand what that person is who is it is it everyone around me secretly i dont know that i know any of them. laughter  basedgod: when it comes down its like who and i wonder that too. i can speak from personal experience one of my people that i know he had a video on worldstar and i wrote some comments and i hated  frank: so it was you laughter alrite fsho.  basedgod: so if you have some comments and they might be a lil personal it might be your friend.  frank: so these people are playing its just something to do. not serious.  basedgod: the scary thing is that some of these people are serious. laughter thats whats scary. the comments give people the chance to say something anonymously to put whatever they want frustrations anything. they couldve come back from a long day and just wanna let loose on somebody. this is a real experiment and it shows you how people are. i know youve heard about the experiment where they test people to see if they would beat up someone whos in jail and they see if the people would shock someone else if they had the chance and the other person wouldnt know. people were actually shocking other people if they did something wrong because you didnt see them. they would shock them but if you could see them then they werent doing that. its a scary thing when you feel like you dont have to see anybody or you have these layers of protection.  mikey: its a scary thing.  frank: thats the real them. thats the real person. at the same time though people are complicated to the point that nobody is any one thing. given the opportunity you could be five different brandons and i could be five different versions of myself\u2014or more. five is an arbitrary number. the internet is just another experiment showing us more sides of us.  basedgod: youll see some girl in the street whos really nice but on the internet is hating. laughter  frank: okay so we were talking about putting out music and i was saying your approach to it is modern. you arent pinned down by the house rules or...  basedgod: the norm.  frank: that corporate america music shit you know i feel like the based way is a lot healthier because its in a flow unencumbered. to be able to take time and prepare a body of work is great but overall being free-form with our output is better in the long run i think. id like to be like that.  basedgod: congratulations.  frank: huh laughter thank you.  basedgod: i come from the traditional sense of music and i did that and i do that thats what i love doing. i love that. getting in the studio like where we at right now and doing what we doing this is what i love. this is legendary. also i come from making music however it comes because you know its motherfuckers that need the music because thats all they got and thats what they got. you know we not worried about if its for club quality. we gon play that full blast in our car or full blast at the house and shit the club gon play it too eventually you know what im saying the hood parties you know or the local the local parties or the people gon fuck with you. you know the people gon make that. runner brings in a bottle of johnnie walker  frank: aye thank you.  basedgod: shall i open this for you sir  frank: there you go corporate backing.  basedgod: you know what im saying thats what that corporate backing will do forreal  frank: you know theyll have that ass on the johnnie walker advert.  basedgod: you gotta put that away look if you got some stock in it im fuckn w you.  frank: i dont even know if they did the ipo like that. nah they over there in scotland. they got the address on the box right here. we should go see em.  basedgod: so look you gotta tell me cus you be saying words i dont even know. ipo what does that mean  frank: ipo stands for initial public offering its when a company makes their product available for trade on the stock market. when they go public so to speak. this comes with letting people know your business like you gotta tell your shareholders how you did that quarter of that year you know youve got people to answer to.  basedgod: like why that drop your investment niggas might fake on you. og like oh you dropped five percent... im leaving and you like i thought you fucked with me i thoughtu was my patna he like hmm...  frank: its true though fiscal responsibility. youve got a board. you could get kicked off the board even if you started it  basedgod: that shits crazy bruh.  mikey: they tried to get bill gates in trouble because when he took microsoft public he bought 35 percent of the shares. he wasnt supposed to do that. i think youre only supposed to be able to get a quarter.  frank: he needed that.  basedgod: thats bossed up. so what would be the motivation of making your stock public and then buying 35 percent of it if you already own it  frank: i dont know. more money equals more control i guess.  basedgod: im bout to force myself to start loving money.  frank: i had a conversation recently and the question came up is money sexy  basedgod: you a real one for that bruh i never.  frank: my first thing was yes moneys sexy as fuck. and my friends saying nah money is gross it changes hands its filthy. people wear it wrong etc. and i was thinking sure. but no i dont agree with that.  mikey: i dont either money is the fuel for options.  basedgod: i was waiting for that and we cant forget that my brother we cannot forget. me my problem sometimes you know we all artists in here and sometimes ill just be so into my art and just my brand and shit so fulfilled off getting the art and doing what i do that you forget that youre running a business also. youve got operations and things to keep this business going and to do that you gotta have money you gotta be making money. you know it costs money to be in this studio. and im not the guy thats always putting it on my fans like hey fuck with me on my paypal. putting it on twitter you know help the boy but its a blessing too because when you believe in your brand and you stay solid through the hard days and the times where you might be like i dont know whats goin on dude or i dont know whats gonna happen and people might be saying aww you fell off. and shit like that and you keep going and you know then that big paycheck comes out and you be like damn or you know these companies or individuals might come support you. ive been blessed with that. with hard work and stuff if you really care about what youre doing people will pay for that and they gon pay that price. and the show money has been going up for me. its hard because you dont wanna get complacent. you know 50 grand shows 15000 something like that and you unsigned. and you know you gotta split some money up get your team and business costs to make the show happen. and im paying taxes than a motherfucker.  frank: we all paying em. trust. laughter  basedgod: yea we all are. you just dont wanna be complacent because at first i was just worrying about paying bills. and now bills are paid and motherfuckers is owning things and now its the next level of career and worldwide.  frank: worldwide. yes.  basedgod: yes sir. pop. you know i feel like im embedded in pop culture right now on this level and thats a blessing where and how far weve come from. a lot of the beautiful people holding me down too. and especially people like yall thats just taking yall position and not afraid to show love and when yall are like on top still show love to people. because everybody wont do that. everybody wont be like we still fuck wit b. im like that though always anybody that inspires me... i mean you see i followed a million something people by my hand. you know what im saying so its like niggas can reach me. i made sure. i followed a million knocks on the table this hand bruh i gotta gold-plate it this is a hand thats followed a million niggas and then wrote a lot. a motherfucker can come talk to me and i made that so. cus im paying homage too so i put that out there\u2014anybody can come talk. if you gotta problem or nigga its real come talk to me. thats how i feel sir.  mikey: influence also a big marker of success. when you wear something and then hella people wear it youre successful.  basedgod: yes sir. bless you my love. and thank you. and thats what ive been too. ive been having to deal with that like its crazy because ive been so under a microscope its like... like me creating a lot of these ideas. and it hurts me as an individual artist because youll see people\u2014and i understand this is life though too you know\u2014but youll see people like an idea that you mightve been thinking years on with the music or a brand that youve worked on extremely hard like with the thank you basedgod or something like that and then you see motherfuckers stealing shirts and using the brand and not licensing it and not coming to me directly and doing this and you know just messing up the brand... ive got trademarks and shit too so im not just out but i havent put lawyers on niggas because im just seeing how people doing me. and you seeing how people doing me. and thats not right. for me i dont remember listening to lil wayne and being like alrite imma make a fucking wayne t-shirt then sell it. i never been like that. wayne can do that i cant and then people got the nerve too. laughter  frank: they do theyve got the nerve. thats what mikeys talking about thats success. even that even in that negative thats a positive. people bootlegging because it means something its valuable on whichever level.  basedgod: and if you aint givin it to em  frank: my last record i didnt make a vinyl. but somebody did and sold a whole lot of vinyl. they had mp3s on it not properly done at all. still theyll win because theres a demand for it. that goes back to the business talk we were having about covering your ass. make sure you can profit from it not just for the sake of profit but so you can convert that energy to build up your next ideas.  basedgod: thats truth bruh.  frank: random but sometimes i prefer my childhood over all this serious adulthood shit.  basedgod: hell yeah  frank: not saying i wish i was a kid again but...  basedgod: well you know whats crazy i wouldnt be mad to look like a kid and have the adult mind. you know what im sayin keep the youthful skin. but you know i love it. i love it. ive finally accepted becoming an adult and really feeling what it means to have knowledge from experience. and for a long time i was really being hard on me. 25 used to always be old to me.  i used to say when im 25... and things like that. you know it finally got there and im getting a little further away from the high school. ive been out of high school counts i gotta count on my hands  frank: yea man believe it.  frank: what year did you write your first book  basedgod: i was 19 so that was\u2014uh...  mikey: 2009.  basedgod: yes sir. good math. he getting that money. niggas know i need my assistant nigga. nigga gotta count for me laughter  frank: youre an author though. are you gonna write another one  basedgod: yea yes i am. im definitely\u2014i already got the title.  frank: you dont gotta give that up right now.  basedgod: the next interview when its closer.  basedgod: its gonna be powerful so i really wanna get back to writing that. like i just been so excited about making music bruh and like all the shit that i got planned.  frank: yea. are you doing any more lectures anytime soon  basedgod: man thank you. well um...  frank: thats very ahead by the way.  basedgod: thank you i love you for that thank you. its the caliber of people that like lil b so its dope people\u2014people in the school system that are smart and that understand the art aspect of it like you said. the modern way im distributing art that was a beautiful way that you worded that... and these people theyre getting it the future. it started at nyu i got my email out online and the people hit me up and they inquired and every lecture situation was inquired. like i said i dont gotta booking agent or manager and stuff like that so i dont have people actively trying to book like hey can we book lil b. so anybody that wants to book a show from me theyre contacting me personally by email. it started at nyu and that was a huge stepping stone and deep down inside i really felt really good.  frank: yea it was awesome.  basedgod: thank you bruh. im sounding modest and cool right now but deep down inside yea like especially the mit one i was really happy because for me coming up dude and this is a real emotional thing too. it used to hurt my feelings when people called me stupid back then because i wasnt in school all the time. i was doing what i wanted to do. but i loved science i loved history and i loved teachers. i cant say i loved all history but i loved science off top science i loved that no matter what. but i also loved teachers that really loved to teach me. and i had a lot of problems early on because i wanted to be a star in the classroom. thats why it makes sense that im a rapper because i was always looking for attention. when i raised my hand i knew it was my time in class you know what im saying i was like ooh i can make a joke right now aww the whole class is looking. i can say something in front of the teacher. so i was always that guy pulling the school bells and little things like that getting my respect and freeing the kids. i was freeing all of us. because i wasnt understanding the magnitude... and the beautiful magnitude of education. but i did. but it was like when youre a kid dude... nigga they got you in there for hours and shit.  frank: the whole fuckin day man. missing the sunlight and everything in there laughter  basedgod: we was blessed cus we had the off campus lunch so nigga i was gone. we had a chance to go and eat and leave school for lunch bruh. and that was a blessing and its a beautiful thing because you always got to\u2014its all about the unconscious\u2014unconsciously i always been doing this however whatever... it was always music near me. and it stayed to this day. my grades and shit wasnt reflecting how i felt inside you know my grades if i wouldve went by grades you know i... you know right know i.... i knew. you know what im saying and thats why i cry you know like when im listening to my music or i cry for how where im at today. because its like by the standards i shouldnt be by the standards... i should be working or something.  mikey: thats beautiful.  basedgod: god bless you man.  mikey: thats like believing in yourself.  basedgod: yes sir and thank you. yea but back to the root what was the root kinda. the root  frank: nigga i forgot.  basedgod: yea i forgot too.  frank: i dont know where i was reading it at but the chain of command in your brain and how its evolutionary... in the sense of you having a part of your brain that in the progress of human evolution was the first thing to be developed the brain stem which is said to control involuntary function. then you have the next level up which is emotional and survival based and then above that you have rationale mathematics and creative writing\u2014all the things we do for a living. that state of the art brain stuff. it was also talking about how it lets say we were nomads again and we were out here hunting for a living and we were confronted in the woods by a predator youll be literally cut off from access to the higher levels. your brain is designed to cut off reasoning and to go straight to the mode of survival so you dont waste precious time tryna delineate you just go straight into survival\u2014the real fucked-up part about it is rarely if ever are we now encountering a bear but you might encounter a scenario thats actually not life-threatening but that scares you enough to initiate that sort of response and go straight to this lesser developed part of the brain.  basedgod: nah thats the truth. quote unquote a man and being quote unquote a man and what that means in society and thats whats hard for us. i really wanna protect the women and protect the kids make sure that ladies know that you can wear gym shorts and not or dont have to feel like youre forced to because sometimes i wonder if these fashions these styles that we think are normal are normal... we should be able to see people anyway they wanna be seen and not fantasize about them or fetishize how they look. so its like a girl she might be hot and she has a bunch of hot pictures on instagram and i look and be like oh shes hot. and she might put a funny face picture up and im like ew like some weird you know. just being herself you know how the girls be doing that just to do some shit and uhh i had to look at myself and ask what the hell is my problem shes human were human. like because i do the shit too. i put pictures up\u2014and especially now\u2014im more comfortable with myself than ever so. youll put some shit up and it might be an angle or something you not gon try you not gon take 15 pics. you gon take that one and just put that motherfucker up and let the world see you. we just gotta keep protecting the young me the young women and also the older people. you cant forget about the older people too. and try to let them know. just keep on moving these walls and barriers of what it means to be a man or a woman because that shitll kill you too. if you really try to live by that you know being a masculine man like oh i gotta protect my wife like i gotta go hunt for some food. why cant she hunt or not and im not saying that and imma tell yall like this. i been punched by a girl. girls done punched me. ill never hit em and thats whats funny to me because you see im not the biggest guy and shit\u2014that shit hurt. when the females hit me that shit hurt. i never hit them back but all this law bullshit they talking about a girls. dont hit girls and shit... well you know what i never hit a girl before and they almost knock my ass out and i might have to hit em and sleep they ass because she almost knocked my ass out so its like you know. and trust me i never hit a girl first ever ever never. it was always a girl slapped me because we might be making fun of each other or something\u2014my play sister she slapped the shit outta my ass for making fun of her. and another girl when i was at the club she slapped the shit outta my ass. i didnt know how the club rules worked laughter. i was at a strip club or whatever and i was at the front part and she was dancing and i wasnt paying i was just looking and i was with my friend and i think it was my friends birthday i took him out on his birthday. this when i was younger i felt i was doing it big rented the limo and everything took him out and man she smack  frank: for not paying  basedgod: yea lip was bleeding and shit like that. and you know i acted like i was gonna do something you know what im saying like i got up and oh okay and i picked up the chair looking cool. picked up the chair like i was gonna do something. and you know deep down inside i didnt wanna do nothing. you know i wasnt gonna beat her up. but i still did something i was like what. security got my ass out fast than anything so i really couldnt do nothing anyway.  frank: i never heard of that. yea she was wildin. thats why you came out w the stealing from strippers song laughter  basedgod: wildin that was early. thats why peoples wondering why i come out with the song. i got some shit thats gon come out sooner and its gonna be like motherfuckers like people are gonna be like wow you know this thugged out pissed off gonna be talking about that you know beating up bitches and things of that nature because now to the outside people they might be like oh this is horrible. or misogynistic or whatever it is but then once you talk to me... this guy never hit a woman but hes been attacked and what hes been through and then you gotta be like hmmm well you know what ill speak on shit and then motherfuckers will hit me like well you cant speak on shit because youve never been through it. but you dont know motherfuckers dont know. niggas dont know what a motherfucker survived through.  frank: yea true. you know ive been thinking about something. ive been talking about moving to london since 2012. the only reason i bring that up is because i was always thinking man\u2014this example is stupid but today i was leaving the hotel and i was at the elevator and something told me to go back to my room and get some kleenex because im a lil sick and ill be in the car sneezing and get snot all on my fuckin sleeves and be upset. laughter its a very simple thing to just go back to the room and get the kleenex. yes i know im already at the elevator but its a very simple thing to just turn around and go back to the hotel room get some kleenex and head back down to the car. a lot of the times though id say well self im already over here at this elevator so im not finna do that. then the next thing i know im in the car sneezing and i got snot all on my sleeves. i feel like we know what were supposed to do weve got the supreme wisdom. with the whole relocation to london thing my mind was playing tricks on me. i started to think if i had moved when my intuition first told me to move... then certain shit wouldnt have happened. so now i always go back to the hotel room.   basedgod: okay peep this: i was at starbucks i was getting over this cold naturally i was drinking chamomile tea every day. i dont know what made me buy chamomile tea every day idk. i was like imma buy this everyday just getting over this cold. i was going through the drive thru every day and it was normal for me it became the normal thing so something told me to go inside starbucks and something made me walk inside and i tried something new i went and i said lemme try peppermint tea which changed my life. healed my cold asap. and im like why the fuck i was so stuck on drive thru chamomile tea and something told me to try something new and i did it and it felt amazing and that was my new breakthrough and when i did it a thought came to my head and it was about manhood and lifehood and seeing how its not easy for anybody like our parents because they were all our age and they all were just acquiring habits of living and i was just trying to live when i was buying this chamomile tea every day im like im livin just surviving the day were not perfect. you know what im saying so you know youll give that game to your kids too you might be drinking chamomile tea every day and if it works for you you gon tell your son hey drink this every day. you can drink the chamomile too. but it showed me when i took the other choice make sure that you see other options and dont stay just on that one you know what im saying and dont stay so strict on that one.  frank: that reminds me theres an engineer named jason i worked with on this album. hell be eating barley you know raw barley and hell have the drops on hand to put in the water to make the ph balance and the minerals or whatever and it occurred to me... see i have friends who are really curious and so whenever theyre around new people they tend to ask a lot of questions and like really try and get to know people. as for me i can be aloof. not in any cold way i hope lets say im big on giving people their space and not getting all in peoples mix and it just occurred to me recently that i should ask people more questions laughter like jason when youre not at work whats your breakfast lunch and dinner game plan and then hell say some shit that i didnt know something i might wanna use for my daily lifestyle. or what someone is reading he reads a lot of artist biographies and id never asked him which autobiographies have you read like why have i never asked him that im always reading and tryna learn from people who arent right next to me. discrimination based off proximity. laughter  mikey: you know its a crazy wives tale about how you wanna start moving on in your career and stuff doing more and have some more sponsors and people were saying how its hella easy like usually you could ask me and you dont even know it. so theres an old wives tale about diamond mining and this dude found this big old diamond and everybody gathers around him and are like what the hell whered you find that its a big nice diamond. im not telling you where i found this so everyone starts going to mountains trees and they start doing crazy stuff killing animals opening their stomachs when really diamonds are right here in the ground. its crazy that thought sometimes that makes it go crazy.  basedgod: just those situations you know fuckin w anybody... not being scared to talk to people and ask you know what im saying cus when i was overseas and in these other places you know harlem\u2014harlem netherlands or something like that\u2014i was just walking in the shit because im foreign and i didnt care and its cool like a nigga would walk and out here and i have to remember that. because i feel like theres so many barriers. niggas was asking me to pull my pants up for so long so i always had these barriers. and i finally had to break the shit down im not different. were not different. no matter how motherfuckers might try to make you feel. you a legend bruh. you gotta realize i just got comfortable walking in random places cus like i got money i could do what i want. like in a way to an extent but like for the base level you know like niggas could go in anywhere and we could do even to eat just say to eat. so my thing was i was so wrapped up in how i look or how i thought i looked but nigga like we should be able to go in any restaurant any place. i used to think and be so into my head and worry about what people thought about me and that used to hinder me. i used to not do as much as i could. like my nigga why am i still eating fast food im eating fruit all time now you know its beautiful we got the fruit downstairs.  frank: yea you told me you went to whole foods before you came here. said you were a lil late because you had to stop at the market and get those fruits and vegetables. laughter  basedgod: i got another one here it goes i ordered a sandwich. i was a little hungry and i automatically flipped on dude like before i even opened it. like why the fuck is this sandwich not cut i opened it a lil bit and it was cut. you just gotta wait sometimes. i tripped like what the fuck. niggas cant get shit right. this dude. i just opened it a little bit just waited wait. not expecting the worse. and im just like boom... im just a fucking ass  frank: dog what laughter  frank: i think we got it man. laughter  basedgod: this is so great. im so glad you made this happen bro.  basedgod:this was a good one my brother.  frank: peace to the god. thanks a lot. it was great to see you in the flesh.  basedgod: you think i could take a picture of you bruh on the professional camera  basedgod: im on my terry richardson.
