{"erick sermon": [" at this club called sensations in newark. and i was djing at the time and yo i got down after i kicked a verse. i wasnt even goin in there talkin about me i was goin in there talkin about this kid who i djed for. i was like yo can i kick something too. i only had one rhyme to my name kicked that one on stage and got paid and shit. then later on moved out to long island. cause i got kicked out of jersey cause i was doing a lot of dumb shit.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0kicked out by the authorities i ask.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0kicked out by eh-yee-body\u2014authorities parents eh-yee-body. they wasnt tryin to see me i was in too much shit.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0reggie and erick struck up a friendship and soon reggie moved into ericks crib on long island where he ended up staying for over two years. it was there along sleepy tree-lined streets that the foundation for redmans lp was laid down\u2014first with one turntable a tape deck and some good ideas and later with more sophisticated sampling and sequencing equipment.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it was me and reggie downstairs in my basement erick recalls with his trademark lisp. he was just so dope. he can rhyme off of anything. i used to sit there and just tell him to rap to me. reggie is funkadelic. i think hes like one of them guys that used to hang out with george clinton and them. hes not a battle rapper hes a funky rapper.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0russell simmons ceo of def jam has known a lot of rappers in his day but he too is taken by redman. he has more of a presence than probably any artist im aware of russell said. did you see the season premiere of in living color he ripped the frame out niggas asses on that shit  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0this past summer redman erick and other members of the hit squad went out with the sources hip-hop heatwave van tour\u2014following out 4000 watt bass machine with their own squad-mobile through fifteen cities. redman remembers the experience fondly: kevin ", "", "  redman\u2014the funkadelic devil\u2014has naughty in his natureredman has tissue sticking out of his right nostril. actually its not a tissue its a twisted-up paper napkin. on his head is a worn-in cap reading red man with the logo for a popular chewing tobacco.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ive seen him rock the tissue before like when we were at sound check for the party that the source put on with the hit squad during the seminar. him and k-solo slap boxed while a few dozen onlookers watched and pretended not to be watching. redman had a yellow pick in his afro. nobody said shit about the tissue and it hung there like the hardest ghetto accessory ever.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whats up with that tissue i ask after i hand redman the napkin in question off my desk at the source on day.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0my nose is fucked up mu is real fucked up he says. i had a allergy since i was two. so i just stuck a tissue up my nose for the longest\u2014not no video imagine or no shit like that. thats some real shit.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and real shit\u2014not pretty shit\u2014is what redman is all about. this latest installment in the hit squad saga of dopeness aint no spinoff. at age 22 reggie noble steps up to bat with the best an mc can offer: a rugged rhyme flow a sense of humor split-personality skills and an immovable presence. on his new lp whut. . . thee. . . album redman weaves poetic tales rich in detail and metaphor full of surprise twists. hes a super ghetto dweller who favors afros blunts and 70s funk. hes the funkadelic devil and the original p-funk. produced by erick sermon and redman the tracks flow like peach snapple with the flavor of the classic funkateers.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0im a big fan of george clinton johnny guitar watson parliament stanley clark james brown\u2014all that shit i listen to daily redman tells me when we meet for the first time at columbia records. i dont just use it as a sample i listen to it daily for my personal reasons. the funkadelic devil\u2014im just bringin funk from hell. the funkenstein funk from hell  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the hip-hop masses first got a taste of redman when he rocked ruff rhymes in a cameo appearance on epmds third album sending a shout to his hometown newark new jersey. newark is a troubled urban center that erodes in the shadow of new york city\u2014its the least educated city in the conutry and the third most dangerous according to the fbi. these volatile streets were reggie nobles stomping ground until fate and timing elevated him into the inner circle of one of hip-hops most prosperous crews.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0i hooked up back in like 89 redman remembers. i started working on my shit after i met  and them got mad props. it was a good experience for everybody. . . i think i was high for like seven weeks. j-mill a staffer who was part of the source van squad got to know redman on the road. from listening to his album i expected him to be super hardcore to not be as much of a joker. but he puts a combination together and comes off like nobody youve ever met. hes got a real funny attitude but at the same time it seems like you dont want to fuck with him because you dont know what could happen. hes real crazy hes real spontaneous. you dont know what hes gonna do.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that unpredictability comes through on the lp with redman displaying the lobotomy style: rapping against himself like on redman meets reggie noble. that and his storytelling skills is why ive heard some people compare him to one of raps all-time greatest mcs slick rick check a childrens story and the moment i feared. i ask redman about the double identity stuff.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0thats some ill shit. to show how creative and versatile i can be. i can be reggie noble i can be redman.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whats the difference  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ones chill and ones not.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0which ones chill  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0reggie nobles chill.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0yes chill and down with the phillies as he makes abundantly clear on the album as in how to roll a blunt. does redman see any conflict in endorsing marijuana use everybody smoke weed man. its not really no big fuckin deal. . . more people die from cigarettes than weed. more people die from drinkin and a whole bunch of other shit. redmans eyes light up and he laughs. cigarettes and surgeon general\u2014i aint never seen no surgeon general on the side of my dime bag fuck the surgeon general\u2014his ass probably puff he get up there high as hell and go yo check it out.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0so is that the shit for 93: afros blunts and funk  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0afro symbolizes the funk redman explains muthaf*ckas dont know that. you see b-reals afro\u2014his afro is huge thats the funk. b-real is a funky motherfucker.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0i know girls out there like the muth*kas with the bald heads and the crew cuts and the fades he continues as he flips through the latest issue of the source. for all them girls fuck yall because you know wy i be havin more hair than some of them girls out there. they dont know afro is the strength afro is the shit\u2014thats back in the days shit. i aint tryin to look good on tv any fuckin way.
