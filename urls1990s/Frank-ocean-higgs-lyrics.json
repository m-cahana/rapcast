{"o.c.": ["  saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside weve been in this room too long recreation is keeping us self contained and aware of each others forms still and in full strides just the same keeping us warm walking in straight lines talking to sleep at night coddled and pacified by versions of mothers  its all new to me its all new to me having you around its all new to me its all new to me having you around the higgs  what if we decide to live by choice all this time i knew that average was something to fall back on after genius ends i watch video only difference is flattened and remiss sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more the tape stopped before i was back alone  ill be back before the street lights on before the daylights gone i was spoiled by lavish thoughts they dont compare no not at all and had this been the past i might not know what to do with all of what youve showed what you give my words cant hold if acts of god break us apart least we did ours  if youve never been in love  "]}
