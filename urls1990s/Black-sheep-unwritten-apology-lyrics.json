{"black sheep ": ["  dont you feel youve been losing me babe your hands are holding empty go call collect my numbers dead i relocated while you slept  i burn up every light in town it cracks me up to bring you down i call your bluff cause you wont shoot and i know my heart is bulletproof  i need to feel you now i didnt mean to bring you down you hurt the one you love and love the one you hurt stay together but let me breathe and this this is my unwritten apology  so juliet frames her romeo you make the cut but i wont follow dont you see youre falling free caught up in my velocity  you want to surf the surface oh then sink into me like stone but if you go i know ill lose i thought my heart was bulletproof  i need to feel you now...
