{"jay-z": ["  this collaboration lives in a place of giving and is about the foundation. i am not making a dime from this collection; i do not stand to make millions as falsely reported. i need to make that fact crystal clear. the shawn carter foundation is the beneficiary and the foundation is receiving 25% of all sales from the collaboration 10% of all sales generated in the store on november 20th and an additional donation from barneys. this money is going to help individuals facing socio-economic hardships to help further their education at institutions of higher learning. my idea was born out of creativity and charity\u2026 not profit.  i move and speak based on facts and not emotion. i havent made any comments because i am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and barneys. why am i being demonized denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately the negligent erroneous reports and attacks on my character intentions and the spirit of this collaboration have forced me into a statement i didnt want to make without the full facts. making a decision prematurely to pull out of this project wouldnt hurt barneys or shawn carter but all the people that stand a chance at higher education. i have been working with my team ever since the situation was brought to my attention to get to the bottom of these incidents and at the same time find a solution that doesnt harm all those that stand to benefit from this collaboration.  i am against discrimination of any kind but if i make snap judgements no matter who its towards arent i committing the same sin as someone who profiles i am no stranger to being profiled and i truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position. hopefully this brings forth a dialogue to affect real change. \u2013 shawn jay z carter  "]}
