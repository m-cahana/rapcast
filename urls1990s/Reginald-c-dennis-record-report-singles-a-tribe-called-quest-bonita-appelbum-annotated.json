{"a tribe called quest": ["  production: artist jive records  yes this is one of the few records that deserves to be called a remix. the original version of bonita already an incredible song has been greatly enhanced by the hootie mix. in trying to improve the original they had their work cut out for them. did they succeed--most definitely.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0using the isley brothers early 80s classic between the sheets as a foundation the tribe easily proves the l.p. was not a fluke and that there is plenty more where that came from. all new lyrics from the smooth flowing q-tip and an all new groove make this single a welcome addition to an already classic album.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0also included is the l.p. version of bonita with an instrumental the same goes for mr. muhammed in which the rest of the quest gets loose on the mic. put on your walking shoes and enjoy.  final rating: 5  "]}
