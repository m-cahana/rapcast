{"az ": ["  today is filled with anger fueled with hidden hate scared of being outcast afraid of common fate today is built on tragedies which no one wants 2 face nightmares 2 humanities and morally disgraced tonight is filled with rage violence in the air children bred with ruthlessness because no one at home cares tonight i lay my head down but the pressure never stops gnawing at my sanity content when i am dropped but 2morrow i c change a chance 2 build anew built on spirit intent of heart and ideals based on truth and 2morrow i wake with second wind and strong because of pride 2 know i fought with all my heart 2 keep my dream alive  "]}
