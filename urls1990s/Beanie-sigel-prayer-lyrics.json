{"beanie sigel": ["  mashaallah  as i wake up in the morning stretch my arms wide before i even yawn or wipe the cold out my eyes i say al humdulillah giving praise to my god allowing me another day blessing me to rise  know at any given time it could be my demise cause you only get a minute to pray and a second to die and realizing that ive come to terms with that one day im gonna burn for all my heinous acts  i know a sincere prayer can only change my fate so i drop prostrate and pray it aint too late for me to ask for forgiveness and increase my faith and guide me on the path thats straight and never lead me astray  cause i know i cant walk this alone im in fear of that fork in the road the devil there waiting to claim my soul so i pray that you hold my hand as i follow your footprints in the sand  now i know i done did some wrong and i aint been to talk to you in so so long so ima hit my knees and extend my palms and send this up to you and hope you hear this  ill be prayin prayin ill be prayin prayin ill be prayin yeah ill be prayin ayee yeah  i often find myself stuck just staring in space feel like hours at a time my mind drifting away cant quite collect my thoughts or put em in place and i grab a glimpse of my momma with a head full of grays  i know they shouldnt be there nah not for her age and then i think of how i stressed her and shortened her days her long sleepless nights not knowing if i was safe or was my name on the list of the reaper that day  i sink deeper as i feel a tear creep down my face i wipe it away now my thoughts on life in the grave i know on that day that three things gon go wit ya ya family ya wealth and ya deeds but two gon leave  and when that last person leave that site the grave gon squeeze so tight ya ribs gon overlap till every bone crack i drop my head in despair imagine going through that  i smell fire then i notice the hole in my pants i drop my cigarette butt and brush off my ash im still stuck but i notice a car pass i hear the driver cussin me out over his horn blast  damn this cant be right let me snap back to life how long i been stuck day dreaming at this light wondering if thats a sign of how im moving through life a reckless abandon a accident just waiting to happen  a reckless abandon a accident just waiting to happen  now i know i done did some wrong and i aint been to talk to you in so so long so ima hit my knees and extend my palms and send this up to you and hope you hear this  ill be prayin prayin ill be prayin prayin ill be prayin yeah ill be prayin ayee yeah  "]}
