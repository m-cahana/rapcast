{"jay-z": [" i very often think about you and the beatles not because the music sounds alike but because they were real envelope-pushers you know they were always about whats next telling the audience. they were not afraid to be ahead of their audience and i feel like thats what you try to do. i mean this album is a lot about arts and things that kids not necessarily would be interested in.  ", " the the truth is as far as hip-hop and the arts we were like cousins you know. if you think about those days with fab five freddy was with madonna and basquiat and everything. you know we all went to those clubs--thats when hip hop was more underground. the arts and hip-hop really partied together but when arts started becoming part of the gallery it was this separation. but we pretty much came up together.

", " yeah i just didnt think it was the correct venue. if it was something really like a real problem you know im not a very difficult to find especially for someone of that stature. he can reach out to me and we can have a conversation well do some good together. but you know i just thought that it was a bit of grandstanding to me and i didnt appreciate especially dragging my wife into it was a bit of a low blow--  ", " and bruce springsteen...  ", " i really like bruce springsteen.  ", " harry was on our show once. he was iconic as he is and i dont know if you ever saw this clip but i wanted to get it for you. this is from a 1968 television special he did with petula clark and this was a giant controversy in 1968 because she touched him. show the clip to show you what im talking about. this is what people we upset about.  can you imagine thats where the country was that just that she had his arm...and you see the look in his eyes its like you know you dumb english broad youre gonna get me lynched. im just putting it in perspective; thats where hes coming from.  i feel like a lot of this record is about the love/hate relationship you have with fame certainly that first track the title track.  ", " holy grail its about acknowledging that youre dancing with this drug you know and that people have lost their lives behind it you know this fame thing and where to draw the line and how to maintain a sense of yourself within it. we look at all the people that came before us who are no longer here with us you know have been in this dance with fame. and its just me just really thinking out loud and vocalizing and hopefully dealing with it in some ways. its sorta like my therapy.  its kinda strange to have a conversation with like three people like im ignoring yall. i gotta make eye contact.

", " what  ", " concern trolling. its you know saying well you know shouldnt--dont worry about this thing worry about this other thing but you dont really care about the other thing you just wanna change the subject.  and i think that the its also bizarre to act like people dont care about violence in in inner cities or affecting black communities in the united states. i think its a hugely important issue especially in local politics where crime issues are actually dealt with. but it really it really is just an effort to change the subject.  ", " its also the case and this goes back to our other argument one of the things republicans have been able to do is cut budgets so there are a lot fewer police officers in every city in america. and social workers and other people who might take a preventive kinda situation. and also by the way thats why unemployment is too high; weve created on a private sector jobs but the republican priorities have cut over a million have public sector jobs and thats cops and others. so theyve caused that kind of problem by denying the cities the resources that they could use to try to do with the problem.  ", " but i think over-policing is part of the problem. i mean look at new york city and look at stop and frisk. i mean policing in communities of color...i mean i dont know i cant talk this better than you can but im curious or your opinion jay z--  ", " i dont really want to scare america but the did the real problem is theres no middle class right so that the gap between have and have-nots is getting wider and wider.  ", "  let me just finish this point because i do want to scare them a little bit: its going to be a problem that no amount of police can solve because you know once you have that sort of oppression you know and that gap is widening its inevitable that something is going to happen.  ", " i agree with that but that does not mean you dont need police in the short term and i completely disagree: stop-and-frisk is an abuse of peoples rights but the african americans i talk to and that including those in congress dont want fewer police--they want better policing. but they want more policing. its like bill said oh the ambulance came very quickly because you were in a white neighborhood; a sad joke with some truth to it. so denying them the resources is the problem the notion that because some police have misbehaved you want fewer police. i dont know any significant percentage in the african-american community...  ", " well more jobs would be better than police. we wont need police...  ", " you need them both. i think again thats a mistake. more jobs those are going to help but in the short term people want police stations. we are very unfair to people live in public housing. it was built badly and they were put in there but they deserve much more protection. the overwhelming majority of perfectly innocent honest people--  ", " they deserve to get out of there. public housing was a temporary stop right  i grew up in marcy projects; public housing was a temporary stop until you got yourself together you moved on.  ", " but even if youre there for a couple years you dont want to be unpoliced. im all for that low-income affordable rental housing was my number one goal--its another thing that the republicans through the tea party have absolutely cut off unfortunately--  ", " but i dont think stop-and-frisk is a few bad apples. thats an institutionalized racism that the nypd has been conducting for years. they stopped more young black men than there are young black men in new york last year. i dont seem them stopping and frisking wall street bankers--they have tons of cocaine on them.  ", " hahahahaha.  ", " youre fighting a straw man. of course stop-and-frisk the way theyre doing it is wrong but answer is not fewer police. you hear people in the african-american community in new york complaining about stop-and-frisk not get the cops outta here. they want the cops to be there and to be better behaved.  ", " i think its also important to remember: crime is still falling. weve had a massive improvement--  ", " the murder rate is at a hundred year low.  ", " yeah so i think you know inequalitys a big problem in a number of ways but a lot of people were afraid when we went to the recession in 2008 that the progress wed made on crime be reversed and actually this is one social indicator that just keeps getting better.  ", " and also black people are the primary victims of crime disproportionately and thats why they dont want to see the police taken away. they want them improved but the answer is not to remove them.  ", " if the murder rate is at a hundred year low why do we need to do so much stopping and frisking; why do we need drones with the police department; why were building a wall in mexico. it begs a lot of questions. why are we such a police state now  ", " dont punish every city in new york for mike bloombergs tics. the fact is--  ", " and ray kellys lets dont forget about ray kelly.
