{"lauryn hill": ["  love me love me love me say you do let me fly away with you for my love is like the wind and wild is the wind give me more than one caress satisfy this hungriness let the wind blow through your heart for wild is the wind you touch me i hear the sound of mandolins and you kiss me and with your kiss my life begins youre spring to me all things to me dont you know youre life itself like a leaf clings to a tree oh my darling cling to me for were creatures of the wind and wild is the wind so wild is the wind and wild is the wind you touch me i hear the sound of mandolins you kiss me and with your kiss my life begins daddy youre spring to me all things to me dont you know youre life itself like a leaf clings to a tree oh my darling cling to me for were creatures of the wind and wild is the wind so wild is the wind so wild so wild is the wind so wild is the wind  "]}
