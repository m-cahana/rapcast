{"o.c.": ["  its another day in los angeles beverly hills to be exact today i decide to take my new rolls-royce wraith i leave my multimillion dollar mansion and blend in with the morning la traffic usually being in traffic is not a pleasant experience but when you drive a 260 plus thousand dollar car with a 6.6 liter twin turbo v-12 a 13 thousand dollar starlight headliner option and complete sound isolation from the outside its kinda hard to pay attention to what happens outside i stop at a red light holding  the bespoke hand-stitch leather steering wheel with one hand and adjusting the air conditioning to a cool 68 degrees and i notice this guy in a third gen honda civic hes staring at me as soon as our eyes cross he looks else where but i can see the look on his face hes jealous he wants a car like mine his girlfriend is sitting right next to him pretending to look at her phone but she is actually taking a picture of my car i bet he told her to do so the light goes green and i flow past them reaching 60 miles per hour in a mere 4.1 seconds not bad for something which costs as much as your house i get to my destination in complete comfort as its always the case when you drive a rolls-royce but to look good its gotta be the latest model cant be seen driving around in a series 1 phantom with the wrong fog lights i mean you can buy those for less than a hundred grand thats like what i spent in two weeks  "]}
