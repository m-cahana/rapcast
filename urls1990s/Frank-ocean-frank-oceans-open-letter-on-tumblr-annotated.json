{"o.c.": ["  basedgod was right. were all a bunch of golden million dollar babies. my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did. anyhow what im about to post is for anyone who cares to read. it was intended to fill the thank yous section in my album credits but with all the rumors going round.. i figured itd be good to clarify\u2026  whoever you are. wherever you are\u2026 im starting to think were a lot alike. human beings spinning on blackness. all wanting to be seen touched heard paid attention to. my loved ones are everything to me here. in the last year or 3 ive screamed at my creator screamed at clouds in the sky for some explanation. mercy maybe. for peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago i met somebody. i was 19 years old. he was too. we spent that summer and the summer after together. everyday almost. and on the days we were together time would glide. most of the day id see him and his smile. id hear his conversation and his silence\u2026until it was time to sleep. sleep i would often share with him. by the time i realized i was in love it was malignant. it was hopeless. there was no escaping no negotiating with the feeling. no choice. it was my first love it changed my life. back then my mind would wander to the women i had been with the ones i cared for and thought i was in love with. i reminisced about the sentimental songs i enjoyed when i was a teenager.. the ones i played when i experienced a girlfriend for the first time. i realised they were written in a language i did not yet speak. i realised too much too quickly. imagine being thrown from a plane. i wasnt in a plane though. i was in a nissan maxima the same car i packed up with bags and drove to los angeles in. i sat there and told my friend how i felt. i wept as the words left my mouth. i grieved for them knowing i could never take them back for myself. he patted my back. he said kind things. he did his best but he wouldnt admit the same. he had to go back inside soon it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. he wouldnt tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. i felt like id only imagined reciprocity for years. now imagine being thrown from a cliff. no i wasnt on a cliff. i was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. i took the breaths and carried on. i kept up a peculiar friendship with him because i couldnt imagine keeping up my life without him. i struggled to master myself and my emotions. i wasnt always successful  the dance went on.. i kept the rhythm for several summers after. its winter now. im typing this on a plane back to los angeles from new orleans. i flew home for another marred christmas. i have a windowseat. its december 27 2011. by now ive written two albums. this being the second. i wrote to keep myself busy and sane. i wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. i tried to channel overwhelming emotions. im surprised at how far all of it has taken me. before writing this id told some people my story. im sure these people kept me alive kept me safe. sincerely these are the folks i wanna thank from the floor of my heart. everyone of you knows who you are.. great humans probably angels. i dont know what happens now and thats alrite. i dont have any secrets i need kept anymore. theres probably some small shit still but you know what i mean. i was never alone as much as it felt like it. as much as i still do sometimes. i never was. i dont think i ever could be. thanks. to my first love im grateful for you. grateful that even though it wasnt what i hoped for and even though it was never enough it was. some things never are.. and we were. i wont forget you. i wont forget the summer. ill remember who i was when i met you. ill remember who you were and how weve both changed and stayed the same. ive never had more respect for life and living than i have right now. maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. thanks. to my mother. you raised me strong. i know im only brave because you were first. so thank you. all of you. for everything good. i feel like a free man. if i listen closely.. i can hear the sky falling too  -frank  "]}
