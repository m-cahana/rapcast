{"o.c.": ["  two years ago i found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face. a seatbelt reached across her torso riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept for the moment behind her ears. her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank the road behind her seemed the same. i put myself in her seat then i played it all out in my head. the claustrophobia hits as the seatbelt tightens preventing me from even leaning forward in my seat. the pressing on internal organs. i lean back and forward to release it. then backwards and forward again. there it is\u2014i got free. how much of my life has happened inside of a car i wonder if the odds are that ill die in one. knock on wood-grain. shouldnt speak like that. we live in cars in some cities commuting across space either for our livelihood or devouring fossil fuels for joy. its close to as much time as we spend in our beds more for some. the first time i did shrooms my manager had to come rescue me from caltechs trip day. as i got into her car i swear to god the aluminum center console in her porsche truck looked like it was breathing like the throat of something. on the freeway leaving pasadena we spoke and i looked away outside at the wheels and tires of cars doing that optical illusion thing they do where it looks like theyre spinning backwards which according to google happens because our brains are assuming something completely wrong and showing it to us. staring i was transfixed by all the indicator lights oscillating and throbbing against the wind. we drove thru downtown la headed west flying on the same freeways i used to run outta gas on. welcomed in by the perennial creatures imperial palm trees and climbing vines living their lives out just off the shoulder. the feeling familiar enhanced on the 10. i used to ride around in my sinewy crossover suv smoke and listen to rough mixes of my old shit before it came out or whatever someone wanted to play when they hooked up their iphone to the aux cord. a few years and few daily-drivers later im not driving much anymore. its been a year since i moved to london at the time of writing this and theres no practical reason to drive in this city. i ordered a gt3 rs and itll keep low miles out here but i guess its good to have in case of emergency : raf simons once told me it was clich\u00e9 my whole car obsession. maybe it links to a deep subconscious straight boy fantasy. consciously though i dont want straight\u2014a little bent is good. i found it romantic sometimes editing this project. the whole time i felt as though i was in the presence of a $16m mclaren f1 armed with a disposable camera. my memories are in these pages places closeby and long ass-numbing flights away. cruising the suburbs of tokyo in rwb porsches. throwing parties around england and mobbing freeways in four project m3s that i built with some friends. going to mississippi and playing in the mud with amphibious quads. street-casting models at a random kung fu dojo out in senegal. commissioning life-size toy boxes for the fuck of it. shooting a music video for fun with tyrone lebon the genius giant. taking a break/reconnaissance mission to tulum mexico enjoying some star visibility for a change. recording in tokyo nyc miami la london paris. stopping in berlin to witness berghain for myself. trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed brandon aka basedgod in conversation. i wrote a story in the middle\u2014its called godspeed. its basically a reimagined part of my boyhood. boys do cry but i dont think i shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. its surprisingly my favorite part of life so far. surprising to me because the current phase is what i was asking the cosmos for when i was a kid. maybe that part had its rough stretches too but in my rearview mirror its getting small enough to convince myself it was all good. and really though... its still all good   "]}
