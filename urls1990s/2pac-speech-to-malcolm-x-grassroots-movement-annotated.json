{"az ": ["", "  first i want to say peace to my mother. shes not here but i gotta give a peace out to her. because i wouldnt be here if it wasnt for my mother.  i looked on the front of this thing and it said start from within to rebuild our original greatness right ok well thats what my mother did know what im sayin. and im listening about freedom fighters and strugglers and you gotta understand that  when it was in to have a gun and be in the street my mother gave that up to be in the house and wash the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains. because we didnt get any of that history from any of those soldiers that we lost--we got none of that. they all went to jail if you can remember. they all went to penitentiaries. we didnt see none of that knowledge. if it was not for my mother who stayed home and didnt go out and do all that then i wouldnt have had shit--excuse my language. but i wouldnt have been nowhere.  so what i want to do hopefully is i want to be--i am--tupac shakur. i have to be a reminder that it aint time to cool out banquets and all that--its still on. its on just like it was when you were young. and you want to say fuck that just like you said fuck that back then. so how come now that im 20 years old ready to start some shit up everybodys telling me to calm down. you know dont curse go to school go to college...well fuck that. weve had colleges for a while now now im saying and therere still brendas out there and niggas is still trapped. and it gets me irked  because i understand that its not gonna stop. its not gonna stop until we stop it.  and its not just white men thats doing this to brenda and its not just white men thats keeping us trapped. its black you know what im sayin we have to find the new african in everybody in all of us. because if we keep running around looking for black and who got the most colors on and who got the baddest dashiki on we still gonna get--and excuse my language--fucked.  it irks me right now that my mother is going through you know she has to get clean.  this is somebody i watched travel the whole country during the time when women were scared to speak up for the black panthers. she spoke at harvard yale everywhere and now i see my mother as whats really going on and i dont see no big parades around my mother now. and she done got dozens of fucking awards. and i dont see nobody there. you understand what im saying so about all this i take that lightly. i take all this lightly.  what i want you to take seriously is what we have to do for the youth because we coming up in a totally different world. this is not the same world that you had. this is not the 60s this is not that. you grew up b.c.--before crack. that should say it all. we did not grow up with our parents. you had parents that told you this and that and this is what went on back in the day. now do you dont have that. you have young kids fourteen coming home and their mamas smoking out or doing it to their best friend to get the product. you understand what im saying  so that means its not just about you taking care of your child; its about you taking care of these children. it hurts that--no it bothers me not hurts--that i have to sidestep my youth to stand up and do some shit that somebody else supposed to be doing. its too many men out here for me to be doing this. it aint my turn yet. im supposed to be following behind him getting the knowledge. i dont even have a chance to get the fucking knowledge. i cant go to college; its too much problems out here. i dont got the money nobody do.  so what im saying is that its not as easy as we mapping it out to be and we gotta stay real. we gotta stay real. before we can be new africans we gotta be black first. we gotta get our brothers from the street like harriet tubman did. why cant we look at that and see exactly what she was doing. like malcolm did the real malcolm before the nation of islam. you gotta remember: this was a pimp a pusher and all that. we forgot about all that. in our striving to be enlightened we forgot about all our brothers in the street about all our dope dealers our pushers and our pimps and thats whos teaching the next generation. because yall not doing it im sorry but its the pimps and the pushers whos teaching us. so if youve got a problem with how we was raised its because they was the only ones who could do it. they the only ones who did it. while everybody else just wanted to go to college and you know everything has changed they were the ones telling you the white man aint shit. here you go check this out young blood: you take this product you switch it you make money and thats how you beat the white man. you get money and you get the hell up outta here. nobody else did that. so i dont want to hear shit about nobody telling me who i cant love and respect until you start doing what they did.  to me this is mecca. this is the black family--i see it here. but what makes it that much sadder what makes me wanna cry is that soon as i leave here so does mecca. we going back to the real deal. right out there you gonna see them same sisters in brenda they right out there. and yall gonna get in yalls cars and drive the fuck home. i apologize. i apologize but check this out: you cant be no more offended by my cursing than whats really going on. thats real. thats real yall. because we letting the media--and the white man--turn us off. you letting them say that the rappers aint real and either gotta be the intelligent person or you a gutter person. we all the same. we all feel it like yall feel it.  i just cant hold a straight face when i see it.  this is proof that we can be together. the young black male is the future of us. and the young black sister is the future of us. its gonna be what you put into it. so if you dont put shit into it dont get mad when we blow up.
