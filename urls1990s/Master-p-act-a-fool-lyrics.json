{"master p": ["  all my dreams came true the day that i met you now it seems theyve come apart what am i supposed to do if you say were through are you gonna break my heart  when your eyes light up they sparkle like sunshine through the rain youre the only one to chase away the pain  you lift me up you turn me around make me a better man than i could ever plan and i knew right from the start nobody else could take your place you gotta understand that when you take my hand youre the only one who could ever break my heart youre the only one who could ever break my heart youre the only one who could ever break my heart   i remember then sometime way back when you walked into the room and i knew pretty soon id have to know your name teqilla down in one just to give me strength counted up to ten and i held my breath suddenly aware  im standing by your chair but everything was fine  your eyes lit up and sparkled like diamonds though the rain youre the fire that turned a spark into a flame  repeat chorus  i just wanna be the one\u2026\u2026x2  repeat chorus  "]}
