{"arrested development": ["  thank the days for our dreams thank the days thank the days for our dreams thank the days  there are a thousand different ways we must try to hear each other say no matter how different its still the same we all feel love and pain  slip off your views unbutton your mind stay awhile 1000 miles light a candle to your soul deja vu 1000 miles old  close the door and lock the time jump over the wall on the other side come on in the dreams are fine now i know why i like this place  i pull the covers over my head black velvet darkness above my bed its beyond what ive seen or read now i know why i thank the days  "]}
