i see it that they copy me but all them niggas seem to do it really sloppily they can really only understand a part of me they try to get the flow but they can never get the harmony im like a magnet i keep attracting rappers its in need of a master kinda like sensei so let them bow their heads and begin to pray and as you pray its best you ask to be forgiven dont be foolish dont be senseless
