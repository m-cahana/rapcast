{"az ": ["  because we all spring from different trees does not mean we are not created equally  is the true beauty in the tree or in the vast forest in which it breathes the tree must fight 2 breed among the evils of the weeds  i find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds it blossoms in darkness and gives birth 2 promising pods.  i was the tree who grew from weeds and wasnt meant 2 be ashamed im not in fact i am proud of my thriving family tree  "]}
