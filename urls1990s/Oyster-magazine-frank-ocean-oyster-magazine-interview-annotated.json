{"o.c.": [" they are. i hate shopping for pants. its the hardest thing in the world yeah you cant just go and buy new pants. and then when you discover the pants its this euphoric feeling all throughout your body because you know you found the right pants ", ". so ", " nabil tells me that you love everything to do with eastern culture especially martial arts. whys that i went to tokyo and apart from it being really hot and humid it was one of my favorite trips. i wasnt going there for a show or anything. i was just going there to hang out. id been there for a couple weeks and theres just something about the pride that they take in their work. that i kind of gravitate towards. i mean not to make my response too simple but thats probably at the core of why i like so much of what comes out of that part of the world. they have that attitude towards their work: pride and presentation... yeah. thats important. i feel like lots of people want to be a famous such-and-such but they dont necessarily want to put in all the hard work to the point where theyve created something incredible you know i feel like thats somewhat natural progression for the ambitious. they imagine themselves in a position before theyve actually done the work to be in that position. so the fantasy of the imagining is like...you know its the whole chicken or the egg thing ", ". youre right though - it has to be work first. yeah. your ambition needs to be to create something good not to be famous or whatever you know youre right; youre right. and even...well i think what youve said is correct. you have to be work first for the benefit of the whole system that youre a part of. people need to direct their energy towards making something great and useful you know it should be common sense but...its not ", " sometimes i feel like people dont realise its actually an incredible amount of work to do anything well. yeah i can relate to that -- i can relate to both sides of that because at different times in my life...hmmm. how do i say this you know i didnt ever have a disciplinarian in my creative life. as a young person i didnt have \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 i didnt have a joe jackson in my family. i didnt have that sort of overbearing stage-parent\u2026 or even i didnt even have a parent who encouraged what i did in that way. and \u2014 dont bring out the string section. its not really sad \u2014 what it did foster is\u2026 well my attitude was pure. i love to make music and i love to write. it was writing first. i love to write and express myself in that medium so that was the pure part \u2014 just the love of doing something but there was also this fantasy of what the lifestyle would be and what the trappings of success would be. there are different little montage clips that you make up in your mind like what a day in the life would be like once youre a fully grown whatever-youre-going-to-become you know yeah. i think every decision i make in life is based on a montage that i see in my head. yeah \u2014 yeah. i think that was me but there was a transition \u2014 and it wasnt like i just woke up and had an epiphany but it was a transition where i began to realise that if i didnt really begin to focus on the work i couldnt see any way for me to become who i wanted to become. it just wasnt gonna happen. and then somewhere in that time of my life it was like\u2026 instead of wanting to get to a certain level of fame or how much liquid assets i had under my name it was more like how well can i develop my skill set you know how far can i push my creativity if im gonna do this \u2014 if im gonna be a singer/songwriter \u2014 then ok im a singer/songwriter but how can i be the best right right. and i was just zoning in on that not zoning in on being the best networker ", "; not zoning in on being anything other than that. once i moved here it was about that. it was a shift to i dont care about anything else right now. i just wanna know how to be the best. that was the most life-changing shift perspective. i know what you mean. writing is most certainly an art form - and you have to have to keep balancing juggling like circus actors negotiating between the business and the craft...id almost lean towards saying thats an art form in and of itself also. thats a very stimulating aspect of the whole thing - balancing the business and creative side. yes id agree. stimulating is the perfect word ", ". what is the worst thing youve been called the worst thing ive been called...hmmm. i mean its less about what someone calls you and more about whos calling you that. so i dont know the answer to that question. im a bit impervious to the things that people say depending on whos saying it. yeah...99% of the people who comment on your existence dont really matter. right. yeah im fairly aware of that. i try to unflip things and have thick skin no matter what people are saying but when people are closer to you...you know you get into a spat with someone you care about and they say some shit they dont mean or that they do mean which makes it more emotional but...you know - you get over it. do you think i could be the next oprah based on this interview ", " i need a catchphrase oprah doesnt have a catchphrase does she no i guess she doesnt. she has a facial expression thats like a catchphrase ", " she does she actually really does have a facial expression that she uses a lot will you be a guest on my show you need to learn how to cry. so what can you tell me about nabil nabils cool. hes a cool guy. i feel like he should spend more time in war zones taking photos. you know some people i meet i feel like they just dont belong in la. hes one of those people. he needs a more intense environment. do you feel like you belong in la do i feel like i belong in la hmmm...heres my feeling about la: la is this massive place and you get so many types of lifestyles and shit here; you find all these pockets. take my friend who lives in malibu for example - i think thats still la county. so he lives in la but he lives in a place that doesnt look like its in la. for all intents and purposes he isnt in the same la that i live in at my place in hollywood - we might as well be a state apart considering how different it is. so i can see myself belonging in certain  parts  of la. right. like when i say that about nabil i feel like nabil doesnt belong anywhere in la county. nabil belongs in saint petersburg russia for a little while or he belongs in a war zone taking iconic photos - risking his life for the shot. i think i could use a couple of years away from this city - i think i could definitely use a couple of years away from this city. seven years is a long time.
