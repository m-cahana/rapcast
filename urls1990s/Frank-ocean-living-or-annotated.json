{"o.c.": ["  living. its a plain difference from dead. seen a dead body this afternoon. the people who felt they had that body in their lives have to let it go. the memories of the life that used that body are just as finite as the bodies of those who remember him. the woman or man that enjoyed that mans body will only have the thin almost holographic recollections for as long as they live. then again who knows how long we live and if life goes on after these heartbeats stop. who knows where life went when it left that body. who knows if it went anywhere not you. matters of faith are matters of faith and faith is not knowing. what i know is that when i see a body without life i feel sort of childish. a kid in a big complicated existence. a game with no rules and no point of winning other than for the sport of it. like the things i know and have learned mean nothing really. a feeling of confusion about the point. a bone chilling awareness of my mortality. still i wanna live. live and bring other lives into this world to live and die as well. some would say we are one consciousness divided. i would say well find out. but we do not know that. eh. life. wheres my fuckin lighter.
