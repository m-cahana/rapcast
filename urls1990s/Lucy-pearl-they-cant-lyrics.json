{"the notorious b.i.g.": ["  theres no need to hate on us so hard you cant stand the fact that were so smart we got the hell off the train before it ran off the track got up on this lucy thing and we never looked back  they cant handle us cause they cant step on us and they cant use us up no more they tried to funk with us but they cant put a stop to us cause they cant control us no more  that was such an evil game you played but yoru mouth wrote a check that your ass is still payin today cause it blew up in your face and now you gotta reap what you sowed lies and deceit will kill your mind and eat away at your soul  they cant handle us cause they cant step on us and they cant use us up no more they tried to funk with us but they cant put a stop to us cause they cant control us no more  "]}
